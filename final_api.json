It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2664746", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Mastering Visual Studio Code", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Alex Horea", "duration": "359", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "826", "students": "78096", "coupon_code": "FREEAPR2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2664746_b9a2_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-visual-studio-code/?couponCode=FREEMAR3", "end_day": "2022-05-05 09:20:00+00:00", "headline": "Boost your productivity with Visual Studio Code, the best code editor of the moment!", "description": "<p>In just 3 years, <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> became the number 1 tool any programmer should use. </p><p>Even if you need a simple <strong>code editor</strong>, or a complex <strong>IDE</strong>, with rich features like refactoring, linting or debugger, <strong>VSCode </strong>is the tool you need. </p><p>Why use one tool for your HTML and CSS, one for your back-end development and another one for course control, when you can have everything you need in one single, fast and beautiful program: <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>.</p><p>Welcome to my <strong>Mastering Visual Studio Code </strong>course, where you will learn everything you need about this awesome tool!</p><p><strong>VSCode </strong>features and topics covered:</p><ul><li><p>Installation and setup</p></li><li><p>VSCode interface guide</p></li><li><p>Command palette, key shortcuts, multi-cursor</p></li><li><p>VSCode <strong>extensions</strong></p></li><li><p>Advanced debugging techniques</p></li><li><p>Use VSCode for web development: HTML, CSS and JS</p></li><li><p>Connect from VSCode with remote SSH</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>Docker </strong>and develop inside a container</p></li><li><p>Understand Markdown and JSDoc</p></li><li><p>VSCode for Python development</p></li><li><p>Create Java projects with VSCode</p></li><li><p>Use VS Code for C++ and C#</p></li><li><p>Build a VSCode extension with a data service using TypeScript</p></li><li><p>Master great extensions, like live share, Git lens, Code Runner, Remote Development and many more</p></li><li><p>Visual Studio Code tips and tricks</p></li><li><p>Run VSCode inside the browser</p></li><li><p>History of VSCode</p></li></ul><p>You can practice VS Code with your own JavaScript/TypeScript project, or use the one provided by the instructor.

Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201cNo\u201d to the former and \u201cYes\u201d to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you and uncover all these techniques in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of<strong> </strong>these activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. </p><p><br></p><p>But how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I've spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden on. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a <strong>7-step model \u201cN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System</strong>\u201d. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me. Within months, hundreds of people saved 1000s of dollars and made numerous connections with some very influential people. I believe it to be the most powerful idea for a business, career, and personal life. </p><p><br></p><p>But what makes it so special? Only my words? Or something else? Well, here is the answer. Drawing on the latest research and best practices across a breadth of industries, the course goes far beyond simplistic formulas such as \"win-win\" and \"win-lose.\" Instead, it provides hard-hitting, practical, intensive, and transformative techniques. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged and amused, and teach you life-changing skills for home and work. The course discusses lots of real-life examples (some of which will definitely get you laughing) and gives practical tools you can use right away to get better results. And what more and better than the fact that you can learn all this by just sitting at your home. You don\u2019t need to get mauled by scrupulous people before you can learn the art of negotiations. Although to master it, you need to walk out and experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>After attending this program, you won\u2019t remain the same; the impact will be severe. AND massive! Your life will change forever. This is the surefire mantra to big-ticket successes. You will learn the art of crafting such compelling messages that people will surely open their hearts and wallets for you.</p><p><br></p><p>All this can be a reality for you as well. Think big. Take the plunge. </p><p>- This is NOT a basic Negotiation training program.</p><p>- This is a Mastery Course to learn to negotiate in any situation </p><p>-&nbsp; Only requirement to become a successful negotiator is you should be willing to break away from all your existing beliefs and keep an open mind while taking the course. Are you not game for it?</p><p>You can have a super-kickass, freaking awesome, absolutely wonderful life. </p><p>What are you waiting for?</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3569891", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Programming Languages", "title": "\u0938\u0940\u0916\u0947\u0902 Javascript Programming \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Shubham Saurav", "duration": "317", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "376", "students": "29308", "coupon_code": "FREEAPR2022", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3569891_acf2_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-javascript-step-by-step-in-hindi/?couponCode=97B4763F0ED289E40C46", "end_day": "2022-05-05 07:43:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Javascript Programming Language easily In Hindi.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Digital comics have become a market having a high ROI. The comic industry has come a long way and it has the potential to enter the minds of customers to help provoke decision-making. </em>Most startup companies and SME's (Small Medium&nbsp;Enterprises)&nbsp;aren't even aware of this astonishing fact.</p><p>You must know that even educational institutions and universities can utilize comic-making to educate their students and keep them very engaged all the time. Comics containing intense visuals and having a special focus on plot and characters can be much more readable and engaging than other literary media, such as short stories, novellas, or novels. It is also said that the structured visual language found in <em>comics</em> offers salient cues about what information serves to be both <em>vital</em> and relevant, at the same time. Evidence is also stacking up to prove that <strong>reading comics makes you smarter. </strong></p><p><strong>What if now we told you, you can create comics with no design skills, whatsoever in 2022 - thanks to technology?</strong></p><p>This mind-blowing course focussed on <strong><em>\"Comic Creation for Entrepreneurs\"</em></strong> by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi Ranganathan\"&nbsp;and MasterMind \"Saranya Srinidhi\" will teach you to create business comics super-fast and easy by using innovative cloud-based design tools in 2022. By learning this course, you can now create stunning comic strips to promote your brand worldwide and post them on social media - like a piece of cake. What's more?&nbsp;You will learn to create comics using an advanced method that outlines the practical steps through a drag-and-drop interface on a cloud platform. We will look at creating characters, selecting poses, choosing backgrounds, keeping props on the scene, typing text on speech bubbles, and using particular visual effect elements on comic strips.</p><p>There is no time to waste.<strong><em> The course will be educative, informative, and practical at the same time.</em></strong></p><p>Enroll now, and let's start booming.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company!

Let us elaborate on this further. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously.

What are the meanings or different terms associated with machine learning? You will see some examples so that you understand what machine learning actually is. It also contains steps involved in building a machine learning model, not just linear models, any machine learning model.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Section 4 - Data Preprocessing</strong></p><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then</p><p>prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation and correlation.</strong></p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Section 5 - Regression Model</strong></p><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures. We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.</p><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in R will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey- </p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the R environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in R</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture in R where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2494128", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Humanities", "title": "Book of Nehemiah - How To Develop The Leader In You!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Boomy Tokan", "duration": "32", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "40", "students": "6350", "coupon_code": "FREEAPR2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2494128_6a2c.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/book-of-nehemiah-how-to-develop-the-leader-in-you/?couponCode=D9673096B4DC0BCF7FC8", "end_day": "2022-04-30 11:48:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn the biblical method of How To Become A Great Leader, push through oppositions, mobilise people & be an overcomer!", "description": "<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It is almost impossible to discuss <strong>\"Leadership\"</strong> from a Christian perspective without delving into the Book of Nehemiah.

The impact of <strong><em>avatars</em></strong> on education is simply incredible. <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>-guided programs allow <strong><em>teachers like you</em></strong> to train in a <strong><em>virtual</em></strong> classroom.</p><p><strong>What's having an avatar all about?</strong></p><p>An avatar is a figure or character that can be created and customized using cloud-based tools. Avatars can be used for teacher training. Instructional coaches use a virtual classroom to train teachers by helping them master strategies such as questioning at a higher level or managing behaviour. Avatars imitate different types of students to help teachers practice classroom management and relate to their students. The trainee teachers stand in front of a projection screen on which they see avatars that are being controlled, or acted out, by actual students trained to behave a certain way. </p><p>Avatar-guided programs allow teachers to train before real students in a virtual classroom without the risk of making mistakes.&nbsp;Also, creating 3D&nbsp;trainer avatar characters across a school has initial start-up costs as well as fixed and variable costs that can be reduced as the software program is used over time. </p><p>This mind-blowing course teaches you some tools - even apps to create avatars in 2D&nbsp;or 3D for educational or instructional use in your classroom.&nbsp;We will also glance at a real-time 3D&nbsp;animation tool to speed up the animation process to create faster avatar animation - without any technical skills required from your end. </p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Impact on student learning studies conducted by the top universities in the world found that instructor applicants have changed the way they work in the classroom following four 10-minute sessions using avatar-powered platforms like VOKI. <em>Look at the first lecture to understand how to use the VOKI platform.</em></p><p>Students feel more engaged and enthusiastic by imitating the layout of campus and classrooms, even if they learn independently at home. This concept of immersive environments applies not only to universities but also to all kinds of online learning; it allows students to be part of a particular environment rather than feel like they are learning in isolation.</p><p>Avatars increase confidence in information sources, according to a Stanford study, and research shows that when characters guide interactions, people trust the information more than in identical, character-free interactions.</p><p>So, enrol now, there is a lot more to discover here in this course about Robot Teachers or what we call 'Avatars'.</p><p><strong><em>What are you waiting for? There is no time to waste.</em></strong></p><p>There are no technical skills required to learn this course.

Then you will be able to learn and appreciate the value that Alex brings to the table here.</em></p><p><em>This course doesn't waste much time teaching you the JavaFX basics, it jumps right in to real-world application.

First thing they taught us was Writing and Reading, right?</p><p>Why it wasn\u2019t Listening and Speaking? Of course, listening and speaking were the core abilities that we were accepted to a primary school.</p><p>And we all know that none of us teach our children how to pronounce vowels, consonants and words like the lessons we get in a language learning school?</p><p>But how did we learn to speak and to understand what we hear when we were a child?</p><p>In my opinion, one of the reason is that we hear words many times. </p><p>When we hear the sound of a word many times, we will have enough sound information in our memory and then our brain will send the right command to our speaking organs how to produce that sound. Make sense?</p><p>Did you think about this, sometimes we pronounce a word wrong and somebody else tells us the correct spelling, maybe we can\u2019t pronounce that word correctly after hearing it once, but in most cases we will be able to pronounce that word correctly after 3-5 times we hear that word, and we are doing this just by hearing.</p><p>Sometimes we feel the need of a little bit of time, just after the full pronunciation of a word, to clearly identify that word. Why this happens is that, our brain trying to match the sound we heard with an existing sound information in our memory. But we did not put that sound information in our memory. In most cases we will be expecting the pronunciation of a word, just like we saw that word on a paper.</p><p>In this course we are going to use some digital tools to improve our listening experience and as a result of listening we are also going to improve our speaking skills. </p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2052119", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Creativity", "title": "Innovation 1.0: Learn To Think Creatively Like Walt Disney", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "56", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "196", "students": "31083", "coupon_code": "FREEAPR2022", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2052119_02ed_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-think-creatively-like-walt-disney/?couponCode=FEB-FREE131", "end_day": "2022-05-03 13:53:00+00:00", "headline": "An ultimate course in 2022 that focusses on creative thinking skills to help you evoke the brilliance of Walt Disney", "description": "<p><strong><em>Welcome to the course titled \"Innovation 1.0: Learn To Think Creatively Like Walt Disney\"</em></strong></p><p><strong>What would Walt Disney think?</strong></p><p>Although Disney has been gone for a long, you know that his company is still at the forefront of technological evolution. Frankly speaking, it was his marketing genius that set him and his company apart from everybody else on the planet. Now, I would like to re-incarnate Walt Disney into this course and put forth ideas from his perspective, imagining him to be your business coach, after all. What ideas Walt Disney would bring to your table if he lived now?</p><p>Yes, truly it started with a mouse and marketing - in the beginning.</p><p>Walt Disney may have created Mickey Mouse - but none of his success would have been possible without his marketing ingenuity. With the genius in him, he filled up movie theatres, theme parks and sold tons of Disney merchandise. Without Disney, there would be no Disney World and no family entertainment parks. He was the marketing genius for the 20th century!</p><p>While Disney went a bit overboard with his marketing, it's not like he didn't have some great ideas though. Walt Disney had amazing visions, but he was never very good at verbalising them. </p><p>Before that, think of all the big concepts created and promoted today through successful marketing. You should have the mantra that should be branded with your company. Let's take \"Think Different as an example of Apple Inc.\" First introduced in 1997 with this slogan, Apple has transformed into a multimillion-dollar business. The idea is simply to break away from conventional thinking and adapt to technology, customer needs and competition.</p><p>You have all these new ideas in your business, but how do you communicate them to the world? You need an ad campaign to get your idea out there too to reach the masses. Now, let's talk about how this course can be a differentiator when it comes to innovation and thinking like Walt&nbsp;Disney.</p><p><strong>Why enrol for this mind-blowing course \"Innovation 1.0\" that has the power to change the world of innovation forever?</strong></p><p>Your content marketing campaign is vital to the success of your organisation. You will know that the way you present your company's brand shapes people's views of your organisation. Times may have changed since Walt Disney's days but his marketing ideas are still an element of brilliance. Let's take a look at a few tactics from Walt Disney\u2019s angle to push your business idea to success.)</p><p>In the superb course, you will learn how Walt Disney would think about any idea about a product/service. We will be focussing on Disney\u2019s creative strategy which has the root cause of the success of the company and of course, Walt Disney, the man, the myth and the legend - himself.</p><p>I guarantee that this course is unlike any course you\u2019ve ever taken. It definitely helps in showcasing the most fantastic and absurd ideas possible from Disney\u2019s perspective and also focuses on how you can apply the same principles of Walt Disney to enjoy renewed and continuous business success.</p><p><strong>Welcome to My Class and Evoke the Brilliance of Disney</strong></p><p>Enrol now.

I have tried to all the aspects of the Solar plants which include Technicals, Financial calculations, Financial modelling, Net Metering, Different types of Installations, Monitoring etc. Some of these aspects are generally missed in the other courses. I understand how difficult it is sometimes to explain the technical aspects, therefore I have tried to take the help of analogies and simple to relate examples and calculations for developing an easier understanding of the complex technicalities.</p><p>Being working as a Solar Energy consultant and executed approximately 50 projects with an aggregated capacity of 4000 kWp or 4 MWp, I have been able to gain useful experience and insights. I have tried to pour all my experience into this course, hope this would be valuable. </p><p>Examples from the industrial experience coupled with tips and thumb rules, average calculation formulae etc would really equip the viewer to gain a great command and grip. After, taking this course, a very detailed understanding of all the fundamentals involving Technicals, financial, execution, would help in building up the required confidence for taking up Solar projects or assignments in this field.</p><p>Be ready to cover tons of topics in the Solar field to charge yourself for your Solar expertise. We will be covering topics such as- </p><p>Basic fundamentals of Solar PV Energy!</p><p>Calculating the contribution of the Solar Plants for curbing carbon emission.</p><p>Comparison of&nbsp; Grid-Tie vs. Off-Gris PV systems</p><p>What are the various components of a Solar PV system, how they function?</p><p>Thumb rules and formulas on your tips for evaluating any solar plant and carry forward the necessary plannings.</p><p>How to size the Solar plant, how to calculate the Savings and ROI period of your solar plant.</p><p>How to choose the best financial model for your solar plant, Comparative of different financial models.</p><p>Understand the net metering and calculate the bills from import and export readings. </p><p>Role of monitoring in increasing the output of the Solar Plant. </p><p>This course has been designed for: anyone who wants to explore the ins and outs of Solar PV Energy. The course has been designed in such a way that it is suitable for beginners and some of the detailed calculations and concepts would benefit the advanced learners as well. I am sure, it will also prove awesome for experienced Solar Professionals who want to enhance their skills and increment knowledge as some of the concepts presented here are not shared in other equivalent courses. You would see them once you go through the course.</p><p>And finally, if you are looking to enhance your knowledge in a comprehensive manner, Switch this Course On! Yes, Take the course and let the lamp of knowledge brighten your career and endeavours. Best wishes to you. </p><p>Practising as a consultant in the solar field, I would share more in the coming days and I do wish to add the experience as upgraded content and I look forward to keeping updating the content with the latest developments.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3209379", "category": "Photography & Video", "sub_category": "Video Design", "title": "Filmora 11/X/9:  Zero to Hero in Video Editing (2022)", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Chetan Pujari", "duration": "200", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "188", "students": "25020", "coupon_code": "FREEAPR2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3209379_f543_9.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/filmora9-complete-video-editing-tutorial-for-beginners-2020/?couponCode=2134307674ADE26DAC48", "end_day": "2022-05-05 04:29:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Video Editing Like A Pro Using Wondershare Filmora X and  Filmora 9 Zero To Hero With These Step By Step Tutorial.", "description": "<p><strong>Who Is This For?</strong></p><p>This course was made for YouTubers, filmmakers, Vloggers, professional video editors, who want to edit for others like freelance.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended?

Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer.
