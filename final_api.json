Or your appraisals into promotion?</p><p>Do you have all of the required qualifications, yet are not able to create an unforgettable impression?</p><p>Are you looking for a key that will unlock success in your life?</p><p><br></p><p>What if I tell you that except YOU, nothing else matters when it comes to YOUR success.</p><p>Did you know, people remember you the way you make them feel instead of the words that you actually said. So, if you want to create an unforgettable first impression, it is very important that you prepare yourself with the correct tools and techniques before you even go to meet the person in question whom you want to impress or go to the event/interview.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked this one question to the many decision-makers all over the world \"If you would like to see the change that will make your organization more productive, what would it be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody came back with one word and they said ATTITUDE. If people had a better disposition, they would have better team coordination, quality would go up, the bottom line would go up, and obviously, success is bound to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that 85% of the time a person gets a job or a promotion is because of the disposition? ONLY 15% depends on how intelligent they are or how many facts and figures they know.</p><p><br></p><p>And almost 100% of the education dollars go to teach facts and figures which accounts for only 15% of the success, and what we are talking about in this course is 85%. This is what brings us to a point that it is not our position but our disposition that determines our success.</p><p>Now, once you are standing in front of the person you want to impress, you want to make sure that you connect with them on a personal as well as on a professional level. Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet. This course will help you create a long-lasting impression and they will remember the WAY you made them feel.

The way to choose which features of your startup or innovation to improve is to look at use data, analytics, and identify the right KPIs in order to improve the aspects of your startup that are most vital.</p><p>The flip side of this is that if you choose the wrong features to improve, it won't make an impact and your innovation or startup won't grow.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "1517986", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "QuickBooks Online 2022 & 2021 Start to Finish", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "148 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "3287", "students": "62889", "coupon_code": "B51037E59CA1FCDCE877", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1517986_f8a9_3.jpg?secure=MZ94oKU9vL4LffSLmiUsJg%3D%3D%2C1641830661", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-online-2018-start-to-finish/?couponCode=B51037E59CA1FCDCE877", "end_day": "2022-01-14 05:30:45+00:00", "headline": "Learn QuickBooks Online 2022 in a comprehensive online course taught by a practicing CPA, CGMA, CPI, with BS tax", "description": "<p>This is a comprehensive course covering QuickBooks Online 2022</p><p>This course is designed to meet the needs of both complete beginners and advanced users of QuickBooks Online.</p><p>You can choose to either complete this course from start to finish or jump to the course areas that meet your particular needs.</p><p>Purchasing this course is more of a long-term investment than spending money on most instructional material related to computer software, partly because it is comprehensive, and will continue to meet your needs as you grow in knowledge, and because <strong>we plan on continually updating the course so that it remains relevant even as QuickBooks Online changes over time.</strong></p><p>Online computer applications like QuickBooks Online change their appearance rapidly, making a static course that does not change over time obsolete quickly.

When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2020-09-15_01-25-06-3a8c355b7d04a65d32a35037dbca4675/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=fVNA-36hRDiKG_eq9vMAWg%3D%3D%2C1641760461"}, {"course_id": "3904774", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Human Resources", "title": "Diversity At Workplace", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nevcihan Dogan", "duration": "32 mins", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "171", "students": "29226", "coupon_code": "JAN-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3904774_476b.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/diversity-at-workplace-t/?couponCode=JAN-2022", "end_day": "2022-01-13 17:24:27+00:00", "headline": "If you want to position your business for success, hire a diverse workforce.", "description": "<p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> is vital for employees because it manifests itself in building a great reputation for the company, leading to increased profitability and opportunities for workers.</p><p>Workplace diversity is important within the organization as well as outside.</p><p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> means that a company\u2019s workforce includes people of varying gender, age, religion, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, languages, education, abilities, etc.</p><p><strong>Why is workplace diversity so important?</strong></p><p>In the modern, globally connected society and market, workplace diversity is becoming a <strong>necessity </strong>rather than a banner companies wave to show their commitment to embracing differences.</p><p>Most of the modern companies can sell their products <strong>all over the world</strong>, reaching many different groups of people.

However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4464354", "category": "IT & Software",
