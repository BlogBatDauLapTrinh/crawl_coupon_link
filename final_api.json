We all know the saying that only one in a million makes it. To put it simply, the moment you will decide to become a movie director your life won't be the same anymore. Quite literally. You'll need to go above and beyond not only to make your films but also to maintain that life you're living. Being a movie director comes with enormous outside pressure, risks, challenges, and constant obstacles that you will have to battle on daily basis. </p><p>In this course, we will cover some of the challenges that every director faces and talk about tips and tricks that will help you become a better director. Traditionally a film director controls artistic and dramatic aspects of a movie-making, bringing words written in a screenplay to screen by working with actors, but in the modern world that is not the case anymore. And sometimes it\u2019s really easy to lose the way. You'll have to do so much more if you want to keep making films. </p><p>I've been making films for many years now and I've learned a lot from my past films, and the mistakes I made along the road. And in this course, I want to show you my perspective and share the tips that helped me deal with challenges and obstacles.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0",

Imagine getting home from work, getting comfortable on a sofa in front of your tv, and scrolling through hundreds of tv shows and movies deciding what to watch. </p><p>Subconsciously you will choose something that stands out from other films, and you will judge it by the poster.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning processes is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concepts or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java Test Automatiuon courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

In this Google ads course you will walk-through setup, configuration, creating ad copy, adding your keywords, and optimising your ads to drive traffic to your website. You will learn how to setup retargeting and Google shopping (google merchant centre). You will also learn how to create Google ads performance reports with Google data studio. All screen recordings show new Google ads manager layout.</p><p><strong>Setup your Google search campaign today</strong></p><p>Google Ads are a great way to boost your brand profile, generate more leads and traffic, and gain more sales. The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign.</p><p>With this Google Ads course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you'll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed. The strength of advertising with Google lies in its massive market reach and the ability it gives you to create highly targeted campaigns. With Google Ads you can drive quality traffic to your brand, garnered from people searching Google for products and services, similar to the ones you're offering.</p><p>To boost your reach, ads from Google often feature across other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, and the Google Display Network. Another great feature of Google Ads is the Google Ads Analytics dashboard, which allows you to monitor the performance of your ads over time. This helps you hone the effectiveness of your Google Ads and adjust your content and target audience for a more optimal return on your investment. It's definitely worth investing in Google Ads, as even if you're ranking well organically, your results are likely to appear lower than those who have paid to promote. </p><p><strong>Write Google ads copy that people love to click on</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use copywriting strategies that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of Ad Copies are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make Ad Copies sound more specific.</p><p><strong>Choose the right keywords</strong></p><p>Search for words or phrases related to your products or services. The keywords you choose are used to show your ads to people. Select high-quality, relevant keywords for your ad campaign to help you reach only the most interested people, who are more likely to become your customers.</p><p><strong>Optimise your Google ads targeting</strong></p><p>Targeting ads is an essential part of a successful advertising campaign. You may have designed the perfect ad, but you'll need to show it to the right people at the right time to better reach your goal. Google Ads offers different ways of targeting your ads.</p><p><strong>Learn new keyword matching options</strong></p><p>Keywords are words or phrases that are used to match ads with the terms people are searching for. The keyword match types dictate how closely the keyword needs to match with the user\u2019s search query in order for the ad to be considered for the auction. So you could use broad match to serve your ad on a wider variety of user searches or you could use exact match to hone in on specific user searches.</p><p><strong>Use efficiently negative keywords</strong></p><p>Negative keywords let you exclude search terms from your campaigns and help you focus on only the keywords that matter to your customers. Better targeting can put your ad in front of interested users and increase your return on investment (ROI).</p><p><strong>Understand everything about new search terms reports</strong></p><p>Use the search terms report to identify new search terms with high potential, and add them to your keyword list. Look for search terms that aren't as relevant to your business, and add them as negative keywords. This can help you avoid spending money showing your ad to people who aren't interested in it.</p><p><strong>Use auction insights to compare performance</strong></p><p>The auction insights report lets you compare your performance with other advertisers who are participating in the same auctions that you are. This information can help you make strategic decisions about bidding and budgeting by showing you where you're succeeding and where you may be missing opportunities for improved performance. The auction insights report is available for both Search and Shopping campaigns.</p><p><strong>Determine a bid strategy based on your goals</strong></p><p>Google Ads offers several bid strategies that are tailored to different types of campaigns. Depending on which networks your campaign is targeting, and whether you want to focus on getting clicks, impressions, conversions, or views you can determine which strategy is best for you. In this article, we'll describe how to use your advertising goals to choose your bid strategy.</p><p><strong>Improve your Google PPC quality score</strong></p><p>Google uses your PPC Quality Score (QS) to decide how your ad should rank. The higher your quality score, the better your position will be. This score factors in how relevant your landing page and ads are to the keywords you've selected and also assesses your expected clickthrough rate.</p><p><strong>Make use of ad extensions</strong></p><p>Ad Extensions let you supplement your Google ad with one of five additional features for no extra cost. You can select from a Sitelink, Call button, Location info, or App download link, or can choose to showcase an Offer instead.</p><p><strong>Learn Google ads retargeting</strong></p><p>Retargeting is a way to connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app. It allows you to strategically position your ads in front of these audiences as they browse Google or its partner websites, thus helping you increase your brand awareness or remind those audiences to make a purchase.</p><p><strong>Set up Google shopping (Google merchant centre)</strong></p><p>If you're a retailer, you can use Shopping campaigns to promote your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better qualified leads. To get started, you'll send us your product data with Merchant Center and create a campaign in Google Ads. Then, we'll use your campaign to create ads on Google and around the web where potential customers can see what you're selling. We call these placements Shopping ads because they appear in a different, more visual format. In contrast to a text ad, which displays text only, Shopping ads show users a photo of your product, plus a title, price, store name, and more. These ads give users a strong sense of the product you're selling before they click the ad, which gives you more qualified leads.</p><p><strong>Create visual performance reports with Google data studio</strong></p><p>You can add Ad Manager as a data source in Data Studio to create data visualisation reports. The most popular Ad Manager report dimensions and metrics are available. These reports can be securely shared with others in your organisation or publicly.</p><p><strong>Learn how to efficiently setup YouTube ads</strong></p><p>YouTube connects you to the people who matter most to your business. Turn viewers into customers, on any budget. YouTube Ads uses Google data to match your message to the right people at the right moment. YouTube Ads make it easy for people to choose your business. Get more purchases, subscribers, website visits, and more. Anyone can make a YouTube ad that gets results. </p><p><strong>Learn how to quickly import &amp; setup Bing ads from your Google ads account</strong></p><p>Create deeper customer relationships with Microsoft Advertising. Deliver relevant, personalized experiences to a wider audience that\u2019s ready to engage and purchase online. Reach people where and when they\u2019re ready to act.

These and other cognitive functions are performed by the vastly interconnected neural networks formed by the roughly 100 billion neurons of the brain. The precise patterns of connectivity among neurons within these networks determines their function, and through experience, these connectivity patterns change over time to enable acquisition of new skills. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of brain function is the ability to learn new cognitive skills, such as the ability to understand and speak a foreign language. During learning, connections between neurons change through a process known as synaptic plasticity, which plays a pivotal role in learning, While traditional learning brings about changes in neural networks through experience, synaptic plasticity can also be enhanced by activating neuromodulatory regions in the brain via peripheral neurostimulation. This program seeks to use peripheral neurostimulation to facilitate the release of neurotransmitters associated with components of learning, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, we can leverage endogenous neuronal circuitry to enhance learning by accelerating the tuning of neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.</p><p>Recent success with this approach has been demonstrated in clinical rehabilitation studies, utilizing peripheral neurostimulation delivered through implanted electrodes. However, while invasive approaches may be justified for treating people with medical conditions, noninvasive methods are preferred for use in healthy individuals</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4494226", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Management", "title": "Export Documents, Procedures, Policies & Incentives in India", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Dr. Vijesh Jain", "duration": "244", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "7", "students": "2913", "coupon_code": "D19337D00FF748AD296E", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4494226_072c_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/export-documents-procedures-policies-incentives-in-india/?couponCode=357130AB2F0A27B27C90", "end_day": "2022-05-11 08:01:00+00:00", "headline": "Pre-Shipment and Post-Shipment Export Documentation, Procedures, Foreign Trade Policy & All Incentives Schemes in India", "description": "<p>Are you looking to learn basic Export Documentation &amp; Procedures, Export Policies, Export Incentive Schemes in India?

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

language . It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.</p><p>&nbsp; It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula 150 millions people speak Arabic&nbsp; to learn its vocabularies you should listen to Arabic speakers in every field listen before speak the Arabic grammar&nbsp; &nbsp;is very important to know the structure of the sentence s </p><p>how can I speak like native&nbsp; listen to drama listen to old songs listen to sport listen to cartoon video clips&nbsp; &nbsp;all in Arabic try to repeat the words and phrases</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4669676", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exams MAY 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Fatima Hajli", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "3", "students": "1636", "coupon_code": "D19337D00FF748AD296E", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4669676_a0ab_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-may-2022/?couponCode=SECOND", "end_day": "2022-05-11 15:05:00+00:00", "headline": "Attend this AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Certification Exam will get a Great Score 90% on Main Exam", "description": "<p>Would you like to <strong>Pass Your AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam</strong> <strong>on First Attempt </strong>and at the same time <strong>Get Great Scores</strong>?

Annamacharya is remembered for his saintly life, and is honoured as a great devotee of Vishnu by devotees and saintly singers.</p><p>He is believed to have been the creator avatar of Nandaka, the sword of Vishnu. He is widely regarded as the <strong>Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha</strong> (Grandfather of Telugu song-writing).</p><p><strong>Tallapaka Annamacharya</strong> was born on <strong>Vaishakha Shuddha Pournami</strong> in the year Sarwadhari (22 May 1408) in Tallapaka, Near Rajampet Mandal, a village in present-day Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh, India.Even though his parents belonged to the Nandavarika Brahmin community of Smarta tradition, he took initiation into Vaishnavism and became a Vaishnava in the Vedanta Desika Sampradaya. His wife, Timmakka, had written <em>Subhadra Kalyanam</em>, and is considered the first female poet in Telugu literature. Their son, Pedda Tirumalacharya, and grandson, Tallapaka Chinnayya, were also composers and poets. The Tallapaka compositions are considered to have dominated and influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. Annamacharya lived for 95 years until Phalguna Bahula (Krishna) Dvadasi (12th day after full moon) in the year Dhundhubhi (4 April 1503).</p><p>Annamayya is said to have composed as many as 32,000 sankeertanas (songs) on the praise of lord Venkateswara of which only about 12,000 are available today. He is also the author of musical treatise called <em>\"Sankirthana lakshanamu\"</em>.</p><p>Annamayya considered his compositions as floral offerings to Venkateswara. In the poems, he praises the deity, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara. His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma (spiritual) and Sringaara (romantic) <em>sankeertanas</em> genres. His songs in the \"Sringaara\" genre worship Venkateswara by describing the romantic adventures of Venkateshwara and his consort Alamelu, while others describe the <em>Bhakti</em> of his devotees.</p><p>In his later keertanas, he espouses subjects such as morality, dharma and righteousness. He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latter's color, caste and financial status, in his songs \"<em>Brahma\u1e43 Okkat\u0113 Para\u1e25brahmamokkat\u0113</em>\" and \"<em>\u0113 kulaju\u1e0dainan\u0113mi evva\u1e0dainan\u0113mi</em>\". His prodigious literary career earned him a place among the all-time greats of Telugu literature.</p><p>While he enjoyed popularity in his days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries. Mentioned in 1849,they were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala, just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room. An English translation of 150 of these verses was published in 2005.</p><p>Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, also known as TTD, has been endeavoring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions. In the year 1950, The State Government of Andhra Pradesh created a committee and appointed the legendary musician late Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna as its head. He set music to over 800 compositions of Annamacharya and are still popular among the devotees. He was the <em>\u0100sth\u0101na G\u0101yaka</em> of the Tirumala temple at Tirupati for two decades. He is regarded as a legend in rendering devotional music in classical style, especially the Annamacharya Sankirtanas. He was also an acclaimed poet, singer, and a musicologist. In 1979, the legendary singer Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi's album Balaji Pancharatna Mala came up with Annamacharya keerthanas like Vande Vasudevam, Bhavamulona, Sriman Narayana and many more. This became a hit and took the compositions of Annamacharya to every nook and corner of the country</p><p>Shobha Raju is the first recipient of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams scholarship in 1976 to study and set a trend for the propagation of Annamacharya's compositions, and was also chosen as the first exclusive artiste for the propagation of Tallapaka's compositions in 1978. Her first audio album, \"<em>V\u0113nkat\u0113\u015bvara G\u012bta M\u0101lika</em>\" is globally popular among Telugu community. She is the founder of Annamacharya Bhavana Vahini (ABV) in 1983, which is located in Hyderabad, India. She has been awarded Padmashri by Government of India, in 2010 in recognition of her efforts to promote Annamayya Compositions. Sri Garimella Balakrishna Prasad, a Carnatic music exponent and the asthana vidwan of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has set tune to more than six hundred songs written by Annamacharya, gave audio recordings for TTD, published books with musical notations and conducted classes, teaching the songs to make them more popular.</p><p>In 1994, reputed Bharathanatyam artist Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala, also the daughter in law of the legendary singer Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao, for the first time produced and presented a mammoth dance production as a tribute to the divine composer titled \"Annamaiyah\". Rare and popular songs were woven into a story format and music by legendary stalwarts was set to action. This production was inaugurated by the former President of India R. Venkatraman and Bharat Ratna-winning singer M. S. Subbulakshmi and later that year for the Tirumala Brahmotsavam. The production went on to become a sensational hit and more dancers of different forms started choreographing for the saints' composition. Based on popular demand in 2009, a DVD of the production was also launched which included several places visited by the saint himself. The production has traveled across the US, Europe, and Asia and staged over 400 times till now.</p><p>A Telugu film named <em>Annamayya</em> was made on him by K. Raghavendra Rao in 1997. It starred Nagarjuna in the lead role as Annamacharya and also featured Suman as Lord Venkateshwara and Bhanupriya as Goddess Padmavathi Devi in important roles. The film became a huge blockbuster and was the highest grosser of the year in Telugu cinema.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1674616", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Cryptocurrency & Blockchain", "title": "Altcoins - Investing In Altcoins & ICOs!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Boomy Tokan", "duration": "102", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "102", "students": "22768", "coupon_code": "D19337D00FF748AD296E", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1674616_84b2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/altcoins-investing-in-altcoins-icos/?couponCode=33E421C36BA9D3DC7700", "end_day": "2022-05-11 18:58:00+00:00", "headline": "How to invest in the best Altcoins and ICOs, analyzing the market and gaining returns!", "description": "<p><strong>I truly believe Cryptocurrency is the opportunity of a lifetime to participate in wealth redistribution.

Sounds interesting?? Let\u2019s go ahead and learn what this is all about\u2026</strong><br></p><p>Let me ask you a few questions? Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods.

It was designed to be quick, practical and goal-oriented and to provide people with long-term skills to keep them healthy. The focus of cbt is on the problems that come up in a person\u2019s day-to-day life. cbt helps people to look at how they interpret and evaluate what is happening around them and the effects these perceptions have on their emotional experience.</p><p>Childhood experiences and events, while not the focus of cbt, may also be reviewed. This review can help people to understand and address emotional upset that emerged early in life, and to learn how these experiences may influence current responses to events</p><p>According to cbt, the way people feel is linked to the way they think about a situation and not simply to the nature of the situation itself</p><p>In cbt, you learn to identify, question and change the thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and assumptions related to your problematic emotional and behavioural reactions to certain kinds of situations.</p><p>By monitoring and recording your thoughts during situations that lead to emotional upset, you learn that the way you think can contribute to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. In cbt, you learn to reduce these emotional problems by: \u2022 identifying distortions in your thinking \u2022 seeing thoughts as ideas about what is going on rather than as facts \u2022 \u201cstanding back\u201d from your thinking to consider situations from different viewpoints</p><p>For cbt to be effective, you must be open and willing to discuss your thoughts, beliefs and behaviours and to participate in exercises during sessions. For best results, you must also be willing to do homework between sessions.</p><p>CBT is an effective treatment for many psychological conditions. These include: \u2022 mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder \u2022 anxiety disorders, including specific phobias (fear of animals, heights, enclosed spaces), panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder \u2022 bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder \u2022 body dysmorphic disorder (body image) \u2022 substance use disorders ( smoking, alcohol and other drugs).</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4169782", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Testing", "title": "WebServices testing (RestAssured + Postman) Complete Guide", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Tigran Ter-Karapetyants", "duration": "525", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "86", "students": "26075", "coupon_code": "D19337D00FF748AD296E", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4169782_c3b3_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/webservices-testing-restassured-postman-complete-guide-learnit/?couponCode=23D58C21B0369687C5B6", "end_day": "2022-05-12 08:33:00+00:00", "headline": "2 in 1!

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3941874", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Contracts Management in Construction Projects", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Akhil Krishna", "duration": "82", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "434", "students": "36681", "coupon_code": "D19337D00FF748AD296E", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3941874_73be.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/contracts-management-in-construction-projects/?couponCode=CONTRACTSMAY2022", "end_day": "2022-05-10 02:25:00+00:00", "headline": "Contracts Management, Contract Administration, FIDIC, Bank Guarantees, Contracts, Letter Drafting, Quantity Surveying", "description": "<p>Every construction project is bound by a Contract.

Because of this, nonprofits must put a lot of their time in creating compelling reasons for donations.</p><p>Like the term non-profit, the essence of a social enterprise is based within its name itself.
