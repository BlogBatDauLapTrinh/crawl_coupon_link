It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What are the major advantages of using R over Python?</strong></p><ul><li><p>As compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available. Although, Python has almost all features that analysts need, R triumphs over Python.</p></li><li><p>R is a function-based language, whereas Python is object-oriented. If you are coming from a purely statistical background and are not looking to take over major software engineering tasks when productizing your models, R is an easier option, than Python.</p></li><li><p>R has more data analysis functionality built-in than Python, whereas Python relies on Packages</p></li><li><p>Python has main packages for data analysis tasks, R has a larger ecosystem of small packages</p></li><li><p>Graphics capabilities are generally considered better in R than in Python</p></li><li><p>R has more statistical support in general than Python</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4098186", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Career Development", "title": "Learn Method Acting, Characterisation & Monologue Mastery", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Sylvia Love Johnson", "duration": "138", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "27", "students": "11172", "coupon_code": "653819912EEE4318626D", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4098186_64ce_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-method-acting-characterisation-monologue-mastery/?source=coursemetry.com&couponCode=653819912EEE4318626D", "end_day": "2022-03-31 17:36:00+00:00", "headline": "Joan of Arc: A Masterclass for the Actress", "description": "<p><em>\"By the strength of her personality and her ability to foretell the future, Joan convinced the King of France to grant her an armed force.

You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you. And the good news is that\u2026<br></p><p><strong>Now You Too Can Protect Yourself From not Becoming Insecure about your Acting Career and Quitting before breaking into the Industry.</strong><br></p><p>Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p>That's right, you no longer have to lie awake at night, worrying about how to nail the next role you want to go for.</p><p><br></p><p>Because when you know these Acting foundation secrets, the exact methods and techniques for consistently confident about your acting, mastering the craft and avoiding feeling disempowered, out of control or lost in performance, you'll finally have peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That's because you know exactly what you are doing every time you approach a new role or go to an audition. You know how to dazzle with your performance while having great fun doing what your heart desires.<br></p><p><strong>Introducing: Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery with Joan of Arc)</strong><br></p><p>The #1 way to prevent unauthentic acting. You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career. The skills that you will learn will provide you with clarity on the path to your career success.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at what they're saying about Learning Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery:<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p><p>First of all, these courses are powered by an amazing lady. Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

Just look at what others are saying:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kathryn Raphael</strong></p><p>Sylvia Love Johnson is a force of nature with her passion and ability to break down acting techniques. I have appreciated her commitment and her ability to inspire, challenge and support young talent. My daughter has greatly benefited from the coaching sessions and precious advice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Margaret Leitch</strong></p><p>I would recommend Sylvia very, very highly as an acting career coach. Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one. The day I got to join her class and be taught. I learnt so much that I don't think I would have learnt anywhere else. My best part was the Archetypes. This deepens my character relationship with me. It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something. Something that you'll run away with and will change your thinking on approaching a character. She was so patient with me as it took me a bit of struggle to get the hang of it, which encouraged me a lot. Coach, I am so grateful for being part of my acting process. I can never take this part for granted. Thank you so much, and may God add you more wisdom to keep showering on us. I can't wait to make a film with you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>At this point, we both know that Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery is precisely what you've been looking for to take your passion for acting to the Next Level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It's precisely what you want.

Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you. And the good news is that\u2026<br></p><p><strong>Now You Too Can Protect Yourself From not Becoming Insecure about your Acting Career and Quitting before breaking into the Industry.</strong><br></p><p>Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p>That's right, you no longer have to lie awake at night, worrying about how to nail the next role you want to go for.</p><p><br></p><p>Because when you know these Acting foundation secrets, the exact methods and techniques for consistently confident about your acting, mastering the craft and avoiding feeling disempowered, out of control or lost in performance, you'll finally have peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That's because you know exactly what you are doing every time you approach a new role or go to an audition. You know how to dazzle with your performance while having great fun doing what your heart desires.<br></p><p><strong>Introducing: Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery with Joan of Arc)</strong><br></p><p>The #1 way to prevent unauthentic acting. You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career. The skills that you will learn will provide you with clarity on the path to your career success.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at what they're saying about Learning Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery:<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p><p>First of all, these courses are powered by an amazing lady. Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

Just look at what others are saying:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kathryn Raphael</strong></p><p>Sylvia Love Johnson is a force of nature with her passion and ability to break down acting techniques. I have appreciated her commitment and her ability to inspire, challenge and support young talent. My daughter has greatly benefited from the coaching sessions and precious advice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Margaret Leitch</strong></p><p>I would recommend Sylvia very, very highly as an acting career coach. Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one. The day I got to join her class and be taught. I learnt so much that I don't think I would have learnt anywhere else. My best part was the Archetypes. This deepens my character relationship with me. It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something. Something that you'll run away with and will change your thinking on approaching a character. She was so patient with me as it took me a bit of struggle to get the hang of it, which encouraged me a lot. Coach, I am so grateful for being part of my acting process. I can never take this part for granted. Thank you so much, and may God add you more wisdom to keep showering on us. I can't wait to make a film with you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>At this point, we both know that Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery is precisely what you've been looking for to take your passion for acting to the Next Level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It's precisely what you want.

We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online. We will go over each option in more detail in the course.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial, perfect to practice with</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They also often offer a student version, which may provide more extended access to the software, and this would be great considering we will be covering a comprehensive problem.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>QuickBooks also provides a free test drive file.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the course will discuss how to access QuickBooks Online, the accounting software options QuickBooks offers, and set up our QuickBooks file.</p><p>We will then practice navigating the accounting software, the free QuickBooks Online Test Drive File being our primary tool. When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "3627690", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Facebook Ads Targeting Strategies For Success Fast 2022", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Yasir Ahmed, M.B.A", "duration": "73", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "122", "students": "27869", "coupon_code": "FREEE1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3627690_dc04_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-ads-marketing-targeting-strategy-2021-2020/?couponCode=FREEE1", "end_day": "2022-03-31 17:22:00+00:00", "headline": "Facebook Marketing Targeting Strategy To Find More Customers, sales and leads", "description": "<p>Get started with Facebook marketing and learn to target the perfect audience without any problem.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4429776", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Salesforce Admin certification Practice Exams", "level": "All Levels", "author": "It Exam Academy", "duration": "0", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "1", "students": "2804", "coupon_code": "E1500BE21AC0E438F23A", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4429776_4332_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/salesforce-admin-certification-practice-exams-j/?source=coursemetry.com&couponCode=E1500BE21AC0E438F23A", "end_day": "2022-04-01 15:18:00+00:00", "headline": "[New] Boost your Administrator career with this Practice test salesforce admin (SU21)", "description": "<p>Are you ready to take your Salesforce Admin certification?</p><p><strong>About the Exam</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Content: 60 multiple-choice/multiple-select questions and 5 non-scored questions</p></li><li><p>Time allotted to complete the exam: 105 minutes</p></li><li><p>Passing score: 65%</p></li><li><p>Registration fee: USD 200 plus applicable taxes as required per local law</p></li><li><p>Retake fee: USD 100 plus applicable taxes as required per local law</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Configuration and Setup: 20%</strong></p><ul><li><p>Describe the information found in the company settings (for example: company settings fiscal year, business hours, currency management, default settings).</p></li><li><p>Distinguish and understand the administration of declarative configuration of the User Interface.

Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you. And the good news is that\u2026<br></p><p><strong>Now You Too Can Protect Yourself From not Becoming Insecure about your Acting Career and Quitting before breaking into the Industry.</strong><br></p><p>Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p>That's right, you no longer have to lie awake at night, worrying about how to nail the next role you want to go for.</p><p><br></p><p>Because when you know these Acting foundation secrets, the exact methods and techniques for consistently confident about your acting, mastering the craft and avoiding feeling disempowered, out of control or lost in performance, you'll finally have peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That's because you know exactly what you are doing every time you approach a new role or go to an audition.

You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career. The skills that you will learn will provide you with clarity on the path to your career success.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at what they're saying about Learning Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery:<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p><p>First of all, these courses are powered by an amazing lady. Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

I have appreciated her commitment and her ability to inspire, challenge and support young talent. My daughter has greatly benefited from the coaching sessions and precious advice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Margaret Leitch</strong></p><p>I would recommend Sylvia very, very highly as an acting career coach. Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one. The day I got to join her class and be taught. I learnt so much that I don't think I would have learnt anywhere else. My best part was the Archetypes. This deepens my character relationship with me. It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something.

has undergone accredited course training in CBT practitioner, Diploma in Hypnotherapy, Mental Health Practitioner, NLP Specialist Practitioner, Diploma in Psychological Counseling and Diploma in Modern Applied Psychology.</p><p>Life coaching is a widely misunderstood approach.</p><p>Some considered a modern form of counselling, by others an expensive agony aunt and by many a bi-product of American's attitude to chasing the proverbial dream. The truth couldn't be more different.</p><p>Life coaching has grown to be a hugely successful form of talking therapy, to the extent that it has helped turn people\u2019s lives around</p><p>What Is a Life Coach?</p><p>A life coach is a type of wellness professional who helps people make progress in their lives in order to attain greater fulfillment. Life coaches to aid their clients in improving their relationships, careers, and day-to-day lives.</p><p>Life coaches can help you clarify your goals, identify the obstacles holding you back, and then come up with strategies for overcoming each obstacle. In creating these strategies, life coaches target your unique skills and gifts. By helping you to make the most of your strengths, life coaches provide the support you need to achieve long-lasting change.</p><p>Stoicism provides the clearest example of a system of psychotherapy in ancient Greek or Roman philosophy. Albert Ellis acknowledged that some of the central principles of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy were \u201coriginally discovered and stated\u201d by the Stoics and Beck that \u201cthe philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers.\u201d However, the emphasis on mindfulness and living in accord with values in Stoicism was largely ignored by them and unknown to the third-wave psychotherapists who followed them.</p><p>The reality is that the life coach industry is exploding.

When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1.
