Y despu\u00e9s de hacer el b\u00e1sico otro m\u00e1s avanzado , en lo que a flujo de trabajo se requiere. Si bien en el avanzado empezamos con un nivel de maquetaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica , poco a poco vamos complicandonos , hasta acabar con un flujo de trabajo avanzado, usando Sass&nbsp; y bemit , para hacer un proyecto escalable. El proyecto es muy sencillo pero nos dar\u00e1 los conocimientos suficientes para poder abordar trabajos m\u00e1s grandes si seguimos esa metodolog\u00eda de trabajo. </p><p><br></p><p>En el primer curso , nos introducimos en la entra\u00f1as de CSS3, para conocer como trabaja. Como evitar conflictos entre clases , porque unos selectores son m\u00e1s fuertes que otros. Como manejar colores, bordes , formas de maquetar, con floats , flexbox y grid. Y muchas m\u00e1s cosas que puedes ver si te das una vuelta por en \u00edndice. </p><p><br></p><p>Como digo siempre que hago un pack , el objetivo de un pack , es que el alumno pueda adquirir varias tecnolog\u00edas compatibles y que esten relacionadas , y que as\u00ed tenga que evitar coger cursos por separado que serian m\u00e1s costosos para \u00e9l. Por lo pronto yo soy consciente de esa necesidad y hago un pack . Pero como siempre incido , son cursos completamente independientes y que tengo sueltos en mis cursos. Todos mis packs estan formados por cursos que tengo completos que simplemente uno en un pack , no son partes de cursos sin sentido ni conexi\u00f3n entre las lecciones. Siempre son cursos independientes pero que s\u00ed o s\u00ed el usuario tendria que coger por separado para conseguir un buen nivel. Por lo tanto , el alumno no ir\u00e1 perdido en las lecciones , el primer curso del pack siempre es el b\u00e1sico y seg\u00fan vengan por orden van m\u00e1s avanzados . El precio que consigue el alumno es que paga un curso o poco m\u00e1s que un curso pr\u00e1cticamente y se lleva dos. Estos dos cursos de css posicionan al alumno en un nivel alto de CSS3. Podr\u00e1 animar sin usar librerias , dar efectos de filtros , transiciones y muchas m\u00e1s cosas solo usando c\u00f3digo nativo .Cuando realice los dos cursos las posibilidades creativas que adquiere son infinitas y sin el uso de librerias de c\u00f3digo que hacen lo mismo y no estimulan el trabajo ni el entendimiento del c\u00f3digo del alumno. </p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-09-18_18-02-27-e011e5e8421cd739dc6ebedeb448e553/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637496560&Signature=bCdovsl2BPIeF1uM06QItWHVYsANW1zcFy8S2JqNHuk5YOSW7knge9TcbSQER0h1EMnukrB81lj25DUbIgEFtNbF9o9EqdQYHTcuqmjFRHfnobjdI4esb4R~vhnrU81IGetE5QHjYoCjlD0dis270z38wci16We8XKVvtZ9tYYRNB3HRP~U7rbAze2SvXDevZdr3zn7B9DGE0K~AhQNymwjjZcpfczH5vxYEFn6DDif3lSp7mxQXwEKhMJyNCcOUrgX5M4f~LAD~IKQ9Kjq9hI1xOB1Od1HUZV7PbhY3jyk6G5E~wpz~UxxElil2W~B~sEEyAoD8PWTpvwhFis7IFg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3385322", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Compliance", "title": "Anti-Money Laundering Concepts: AML, KYC and Compliance", "level": "All Levels", "author": "GenMan Solutions", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "2374", "students": "70270", "coupon_code": "AMLNOV2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3385322_e814.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/anti-money-laundering-aml-kyc/?couponCode=AMLNOV2", "end_day": "2021-11-22 06:23:32+00:00", "headline": "(Highest number of Students Enrolled) Anti-Money Laundering(AML), AML policies, AML KYC & AML Compliance", "description": "<p>Welcome to the course on <strong>Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</strong>, where you will learn about the key issues faced by financial institutions today: <strong>Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing</strong>.

This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=-A5HOdKi6FgRPij0HXlpAA%3D%3D%2C1637496631"}, {"course_id": "2970650", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Sales", "title": "Customer Retention: Maximise Your Profits", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Customer Core", "duration": "1.5 hours", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "9", "students": "2325", "coupon_code": "4E62FA872421C1F4AE8D", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2970650_f472.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/customer-retention-max-profits-fast/?couponCode=4E62FA872421C1F4AE8D", "end_day": "2021-11-24 13:33:52+00:00", "headline": "How CRM, Customer Care, Customer Service, Customer Satisfaction and Customer Experience will 10X your profits.", "description": "<p><strong>What is your ideal work life? </strong>Does the word carefree come to mind?</p><p>Free from worry and stress of having to make more money to pay the bills each month.</p><p>Ultimately, <strong>a carefree work life is what this course is all about.</strong></p><p>I want to show you a fast, cost effective and reliable way to increase your sales and profits.</p><p><strong>You want a carefree work life, and you're either:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Someone who has spent hours awake at night trying to figure out how to get new customers.</p></li><li><p>Someone who sees others being successful, but isn't having as much success as you'd like, despite working really hard every day.</p></li></ol><p>I can help you, no matter what situation you're in.</p><p><strong>THIS COURSE WILL SHOW YOU:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Why you need to focus in customer retention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The benefits of customer retention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Free tools to help you implement a customer retention strategy.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to figure out where you are with your existing customer retention efforts.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What you need to do before you create your customer retention strategy.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to get your team on board your customer retention strategy.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Great tips for getting your organisation to focus on Customer Retention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bullet proof customer retention strategies to use today.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How CRM, customer care, customer service, customer satisfaction and customer experience will lead to customer retention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Valuable customer retention tactics that will get results.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Practical tips to have your customers return often and purchase more.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Examples of successful customer retention in action.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Diligently track and measure your customer retention efforts.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Along with the video content of the course, there are many bonuses.</p><p><strong>BONUSES:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Downloadable resources and guides</p></li><li><p>An audio version of the course to listen on the go</p></li><li><p>Assignments that make you productive while taking the course</p></li><li><p>An instructor who truly cares about your success</p></li></ul><p><strong>I SHARE PRACTICAL SECRETS IN THIS COURSE</strong></p><p>These are techniques that I have used to grow profits in multiple businesses They are techniques that other successful business owners are using today to grow their sales.</p><p><strong>IT WILL NEVER BE A BETTER TIME TO START A CUSTOMER RETENTION STRATEGY</strong></p><p>The key thing to know before starting is that you need very little to get started.</p><p>You don't need a to know how to sell</p><p>You don't need to know how market.</p><p>You just need to be consistent and persistent.

Let us elaborate this further. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously.

A\u00fan asi recomiendo hacer javascript entero y canvas antes de llegar al juego , porque gracias a ese nivel que adquiriras. Podr\u00e1s hacer juegos mucho m\u00e1s complejos . Este curso de juegos esta dividido en tres bloques, primero programaci\u00f3n , segundo , conceptos de videojuegos y tercero , el juego en s\u00ed. </p><p><br></p><p>Esta asegurado un nivel alto o muy alto de javascript cuando acabes el pack entero y estar\u00e1s preparado para afrontar con \u00e9xito y comprender cualquier libreria de javascript sin muchos quebraderos de cabeza. </p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-09-18_16-00-32-5b3ad893762c9316faaaf053827ba63f/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637496669&Signature=YVxsdqUaD293ESOqWAk7K3BhrnIQRpAdohtT0hr2AwbSUpUKFAW78RxOjaT3Ds9EhGZgzflyUGPg56I6uXdu6m86djxPKtAmQt1Lo6V30m~Urp5Co9QPGaciQnEP9F04OqN0hgu4XphpUlpvOaTxGOjdoS5yqd6cGx4v4BJBCf23uXnGezUR4YEOVZA4FVR1xFkrhm5Gc8nqSyixn0MCyRBb~P0FqXFzhwdwNeGeNyvOGsaoarICRHj5mF4zxm93tbFfuFd4Y6RQW1jIUMpK5kPxn9oS1YpEa5mObNw8HxJR1yyH7WI9av426MtU5A9F2621NdCFRxb1Teja7eMIFQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3221613", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_category": "General Health", "title": "Quit Smoking with Hypnosis & Self Hypnosis", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Chris Spink", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "8", "students": "2270", "coupon_code": "BLACKFRIDAYFREE", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3221613_6d6e_2.jpg?secure=N1fY0M-OWHbyjtV59rzOig%3D%3D%2C1637566871", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quitting-smoking-with-hypnosis-self-hypnosis/?couponCode=BLACKFRIDAYFREE", "end_day": "2021-11-25 23:15:11+00:00", "headline": "Quit Smoking Permanently & Easily Without Withdrawals Using Hypnosis and Self Hypnosis in 14 Days", "description": "<p><strong>IF YOU COULD STOP SMOKING EASILY WITHOUT WITHDRAWALS OR CRAVINGS, </strong></p><p><strong>WOULD YOU DO IT?</strong></p><p>Just suppose there were a MAGIC METHOD of stopping smoking which enables any smoker, INCLUDING YOU, to become a non-smoker in 2 weeks:</p><ul><li><p><strong>\u200b</strong>Permanently</p></li><li><p>\u200bWithout needing willpower</p></li><li><p>\u200bWithout suffering from withdrawal symptoms</p></li><li><p>\u200bWithout weight gain</p></li><li><p>\u200bWithout scare tactics, pills, patches, or other gimmicks</p></li></ul><p><strong>What if when you used this method:</strong></p><ul><li><p>There is no initial period of feeling deprived or unhappy</p></li><li><p>You gain control of your life</p></li><li><p>You enjoy social occasions more</p></li><li><p>You feel more confident and better equipped to handle stress</p></li><li><p>\u200bYou can concentrate better</p></li><li><p>\u200bYou do not spend the rest of your life having to resist the occasional temptation to light a cigarette</p></li><li><p>You will clear your lungs, strengthen your immune system and decrease your risk of lung disease or cancer</p></li><li><p>You\u2019ll have more money to do the things you want to do</p></li></ul><p><strong>And... you not only find it easy to stop,<br>but can actually enjoy the process and become more empowered.<br></strong></p><p><strong>IF THERE WERE SUCH A MAGICAL METHOD</strong></p><p><strong>WOULD YOU USE IT?</strong></p><p>Chances are you would.

I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover the customer journey to purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find your IDEAL customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to HONE IN ON YOUR PERFECT CUSTOMER. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be sharing POWERFUL INSIDER TARGETING STRATEGIES that will SUPERPOWER your custom and lookalike audience set up.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting the most out of the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and FAST.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events to take your Ad game to the next level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to GET MORE from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Facebook Ads Reporting and Attributions</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll show you how to use Facebook Reporting to create interactive weekly email reports on all your Facebook Ad campaigns. This will help you see how all your Facebook Ads are performing and where your Ad spend is going.</p><p>This is invaluable information as you'll be able to funnel your ad spend to where it returns you the best investment. It also helps you identify weak areas, so you can see where you might be going wrong, and where you can improve.</p><p>You\u2019ll also learn how to harness the power of Facebook Attributions, so you can use data driven tracking models to understand browser\u2019s interaction with your ads, across multiple platforms.</p><p>Facebook attributions let you gain a greater insight into the customer journey to purchase. This is an awesome tool for any advertiser, as it enables you to measure the incremental impact of each of your ads in your customer\u2019s path to conversion.</p><p><em>WAIT THAT'S NOT ALL\u2026</em></p><p>You'll also be getting some amazing bonuses that will really help you to TAKE YOUR MARKETING GAME TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</p><p><strong>Convert more, sell FASTER</strong></p><p>You'll receive my EXCLUSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR MAXIMISING YOUR AD CONVERSION RATE ON FACEBOOK.</p><p>Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages.

Lyrebird is an AI research division within Descript, currently and the team is building a new generation of tools for media editing and synthesis that make content creation more accessible and expressive.&nbsp; Sounding to be a wow factor, this new neural voice cloning technology from Lyrebird (that is discussed in the course) synthesises the voice of a human from audio samples fed to it.</p><p><strong>What is Voice-Cloning and how this course can be the next big revolution in technology in 2021?</strong></p><p>Voice cloning corresponds to a few-shot generative speech modelling conditioned on the identity of the speaker.</p><p>Typically, cloning a voice requires hours of recorded speech to build a dataset and then use the dataset to train a new voice model. Each speaker\u2019s embeddings can be applied to synthetically voice a random utterance or phrase - to be intact, or even users can input their own texts and the&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;tool will voice them. This means the AI tool can voice words, sentences and phrases you have not even spoken at all, for that matter. But, this course depicts secrets that can in fact go a long way to change the world of sound for the better. no longer. New technology tools are on the rise and in fact - these groundbreaking Real-Time Voice Cloning Tools allow anyone to clone a voice from a set of audio samples.&nbsp;Some of these voice-cloning tools have recording capabilities in-built that you can use or leverage within the tool itself.</p><p><em>This course serves to be a game-changer this year and beyond as it allows you to replace recorded words and phrases with a synthesised speech that's tonally blended with the surrounding audio - once the audio samples that you fed to it are finalised. Isn't that information breathtaking?</em></p><p>Why wait?</p><p>Enrol now, get started today and evoke the brilliance of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence usage of voice cloning and TTS (text to speech) and be surprised like you never have been.

Students who want a useful reference tool they can keep, and one that can be more easily updated then a textbook, will benefit from a resource such as this.</p><p>Financial accounting is a LARGE topic and is not something that can be done well in 5, 10, or 20, hours of content, as you may see claimed elsewhere. We will cover accounting theory because theory and concepts are what accounting is. We need to learn theory so we can make appropriate adjustments in the real world. Learning procedures without understanding the theory will make us inflexible and unable to adapt to the ever-changing environment. We will learn the theory while we apply them to procedures.</p><p>Financial accounting is relatively standardized in format. In other words, most accounting institutions will cover much the same topics, often in much the same order. We suggest looking up a standard accounting textbook, checking the index, and comparing the topics to the courses you are considering purchasing. We believe this course will line up well to anybody\u2019s needs who want to learn financial accounting.</p><p>Below is a list of topics by section:</p><p>Section SEC 1 An Introduction to Accounting, The Double Entry Accounting System, &amp; Recording Transactions using Debits and Credits</p><p>Section SEC 2 \u2013 Recording Period End Adjusting Entries</p><p>Section SEC 3 \u2013 Recording Closing Entries</p><p>Section SEC 4 - Merchandising Transactions \u2013 Transactions Involving Inventory</p><p>Section SEC 5 \u2013 Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average Methods)</p><p>Section SEC 6 \u2013 Subsidiary Ledgers &amp; Special Journals</p><p>Section SEC 7 \u2013 Bank Reconciliations &amp; Cash Internal Controls</p><p>Section SEC 8 \u2013 Accounts Receivable \u2013 Allowance Method &amp; Direct Write Off Methods</p><p>Section SEC 9 \u2013 Depreciation Methods &amp; Property Plant &amp; Equipment</p><p>Section SEC 10 \u2013 Payroll Accounting</p><p>Section SEC 11 \u2013 Partnership Accounting</p><p>Section SEC 12 \u2013 Accounting for Corporations</p><p>Section SEC 13 \u2013 Bonds Payable, Notes Payable, &amp; Long-Term Liabilities</p><p>Section SEC 14 \u2013 Statement of Cash Flows</p><p>The course will start off at the basics and work all the way through the financial accounting topics generally covered in an undergraduate program.</p><p>First, we will describe what financial accounting is and the objectives of financial accounting. We will learn how the double-entry accounting system works by applying it to the accounting equation. In other words, we will use an accounting equation to record financial transactions using a double-entry accounting system.</p><p>We well learn all topics by fist having presentations and then applying the skills using Excel practice problems. If you are not familiar with how to navigate through Excel, it is OK. We will use preformatted worksheets, have step by step instructional videos, and will start off relatively slow.</p><p>The next step is to apply the double-entry accounting system using debits and credits. Debits and credits are a new concept to most people not familiar with accounting, or possibly worse, many people have misconceptions about the meaning of debit and credit due to its use in areas like bank statements, credit cards, and debit cards.</p><p>We will cover the rules related to debits and credits in a lot of detail. We will then record similar transactions we had done using the accounting equation, but now using debits and credits.</p><p>After we get good at recording transactions using debits and credits, we will learn period end adjusting entries. Adjusting entries are used to adjust the books to represent an accrual basis at the period end better, and they are a great tool for enforcing the concepts of accrual accounting.</p><p>Next, we will use the data we have learned to put together by recording financial transactions into financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. We will learn to construct a statement of cash flows much later in the course.</p><p>After completing the financial statements, we will learn how to journalize and post-closing entries. Closing entries are used to clean out temporary accounts and prepare for the transactions that will be recorded in the next period.</p><p>The steps we have just outlined are critically important to all accounting, and we will need a reasonably good understanding of them to move forward. In other words, the better we understand these concepts, the more natural learning the rest of financial accounting will be. We recommend spending a good deal of time on these concepts and reviewing them often. Think of these skills as a baseball player thinks of playing catch or a musician thinks of playing the basic scales. We should put in some practice with the basics every day.</p><p>Next, we will add inventory to the mix. All the skills we have learned will still apply, but we will now record transactions related to the purchase and sale of inventory.</p><p>We will also learn to track inventory using different methods. We can use specific identification. In other words, we can track the exact unit of inventory that was sold as a car dealership would do. However, companies generally use a cost flow assumption with smaller items that are the same in nature, assumptions like First In Fist Out (FIFO) or Last In Last Out (LIFO). A company may also use a weighted average method.</p><p>Next well will consider subsidiary ledger and special journals. Our main focus is on subsidiary ledger related to accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accounts receivable represents money owed to the organization.</p><p>The general ledger will provide the transactions that make up the accounts receivable account balance by date. However, we will want to see this data reported by customers, so we know who owes the company money and how much, and this is the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger.</p><p>We have a similar situation with accounts payable. Accounts payable represent vendors the company owes money to. We will want to sort this information by vendors, so we know which vendors we owe money to and how much.</p><p>Next, we will cover bank reconciliation and internal controls related to cash. The bank reconciliation is one of the most important internal controls outside of the double-entry accounting system itself. All businesses, large and small, should perform a bank reconciliation. The bank reconciliation will reconcile the cash balance on the company\u2019s books to the cash balance reported by the bank as of a specific date, the date of the bank statement, typically the end of the month.</p><p>The bank statement balance will not agree to the book balance due to outstanding items, items recorded by the company, but which have not yet cleared the bank. The outstanding items will be the reconciling items in a bank reconciliation.</p><p>Next will learn how to value accounts receivable and deal with those accounts we will not be able to collect on. In other words, accounts receivable represent money owed to the business for work done in the past. However, some of those receivables may not ever be paid. How do we account for the a customers we do not think will pay and how do we value the accounts receivable account if we believe some of the receivable will may not be collected in the future, but we do not know which ones?</p><p>GAAP generally requires the use of what is called the allowance method to value accounts receivable. We will compare the allowance method to the direct write off method, an easier method but one that does not conform to accrual accounting as well.</p><p>Next, we will cover property plant and equipment. The most difficult concept related to property plant and equipment is calculating and recording depreciation. Deprecation can be calculated using different methods, including the straight-line method, the double-declining balance method, and the units of production method. We will compare and contrast each method in detail.</p><p>We will also consider how to record the purchase and sale of property plant and equipment.</p><p>Next, we will discuss the tracking and reporting of payroll. Payroll is a very large topic because of the payroll laws included in it. We will discuss how to calculate payroll taxes, including federal income tax FIT, social security, and Medicare. We will record journal entries related to payroll. Payroll journal entries are some of the longest and most complex journal entries recorded in the standard accounting cycle.</p><p>Next, we will learn partnership accounting. The concepts we learned related to the double-entry accounting system will apply to partnerships. Our focus now will be on those transactions unique to a partnership form of entity. For example, we will discuss how to allocate net income to each partners capital account. A partnership type of entity is very flexible, and there are many different ways partners can agree on to allocate income.</p><p>We will discuss how to record transactions when a new partner is added to a partnership or when an existing partner leaves a partnership.</p><p>We will also cover how to record the liquidation of a partnership. Much of the liquidation process will apply to the closing of other business entity types as well. However, the partnership type of entity has the added difficulty of allocating the final proceeds to the partners in accordance with their capital accounts.</p><p>Then we will consider transaction unique to a corporation format of entity. Like the partnership form of entity, the corporation will use the same double-entry accounting system we learned at the beginning of the course. In this section, we will learn how to record the sale of capital stock and the sale of preferred stock. We will record transaction related to the purchase of treasury stock. We will discuss how to record cash dividends and stock dividends.</p><p>Then we will learn concepts related to bonds payable, notes payable, and long term liabilities. Many people are familiar with bonds as a type of investment. We will consider bonds from the other side of the transaction with the issuance of bonds. Bonds are often used as a tool to understand the time-value of money concept and interest rates at a deeper level. Therefore, even if you do not plan on recording many transactions related to the issuance of bonds, it is a useful process to learn valuable concepts. Bonds are often issued at a premium or a discount. The premium or discount is then amortized over the life of the bond.</p><p>We will discuss how to record the initial sale of the bond. We will talk about how to amortize the bond discount and premium. We will record transactions related to bond interest, and we will discuss transactions for the dissolution of the bonds.</p><p>The course will also cover the recording of notes payable. One of the most complex components of notes payable is the breaking out of interest and principal portion of the payment. For the task of breaking out interest and principal, we will need an amortization schedule. We will build amortization schedules from scratch, a useful skill to understand.</p><p>The second complication with notes payable is breaking out the current and long term portion of the note. We will use the amortization schedule to perform the task of calculating the current and long term portion of the notes payable.</p><p>Finally, we will discuss how to create a statement of cash flows. The statement of cash flows is on the of primary financial statements along with the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity, but the statement of cash flows can be more complicated to construct.</p><p>The statement of cash flows represents the flow of cash broken out into three categories, operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. We have constructed the financial statements using an accrual basis rather than a cash basis. We can think of the statement of cash flows as converting the accrual basis to a cash basis.</p><p>We can use two methods when constructing the operating section of the statement of cash flows, the direct method, and the indirect method. The indirect method is more common and often required, even if we also add the direct method. The indirect method starts with net income in then backs into cash flow from operations.</p><p><strong>Sample of part to test in the book that comes with the course: </strong></p><p>The first questions asked when introduced to any new topic are often:</p><p>\u2022 What is it?</p><p>\u2022 Why do I need to know it?</p><p>We will address the second question first: why do I need to know accounting?</p><p>Answer: Because it\u2019s fun. Because accounting is fun is likely not the first thing that popped into your mind, but we want to start off with this concept, the idea of thinking of accounting as a kind of game, a sort of puzzle, something we can figure out. Thinking of accounting as a game will make learning accounting much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Accounting </strong>can be defined as an \u201cinformation and measurement system that identifies, records, and communicates relevant information about a company\u2019s business activities\u201d<strong> </strong>(John J. Wild, 2015).</p><p>The process of accounting includes the accumulation of data into a relevant form, which can be used for practical decision making.</p><p>Data is often identified using forms and documents such as bills, invoices, and timesheets. Once identified information is input into an accounting system, often an electronic one. The end goal of financial accounting is the creation of financial statements including a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. The financial statements are used to make relevant decisions.</p><p>There are many reasons to learn accounting concepts, other than it being fun, although we always want to keep the fun factor in mind. Some of the most obvious reasons for learning accounting include:</p><p>\u00b7 Accounting provides a format to understand business whether we are in the accounting department or not. Accounting is the language of business, a way of communicating business objectives and performance. All areas and departments benefit from understanding accounting because it provides a way to communicate between departments and communication is critical to business success.</p><p>\u00b7 Accounting concepts apply to our personal finances. We all need to deal with our personal finances and learning basic accounting concepts and recording techniques helps ease our mind when dealing with our financial tasks.</p><p>Other reasons for learning accounting, which are not so obvious, include that accounting is a great tool to help develop critical thinking skills. Accounting requires reasoning to work through problems, and the practice of accounting will refine reasoning abilities and help us approach problems in a more systematic way, a more efficient way.</p><p>Accounting can also provide the same sense of satisfaction we receive when completing a puzzle, when mastering a new musical pattern, or when playing a game skillfully. Accounting can provide the same shot of dopamine when we figure out a problem, discern how something works and can claim that the double entry accounting system is in balance.</p><p><strong>Accounting can be compared to a game of checkers</strong></p><p>For example, the game of checkers starts with setting up pieces on a board, a spreadsheet, following a set of rules. To set up the board, we need to have memorized the rules for doing so. Memorizing rules is not the fun aspect of checkers but is a necessary one to receiving the enjoyment of playing the game. Once the board is set up the game of checkers is played by moving pieces according to a set of rules to achieve a certain objective, the elimination of opponent\u2019s pieces.</p><p>Accounting is similar in that we will start off by learning how to set up the board, the accounting board being a T account or ledger. As with checkers, we will need to memorize where the pieces fit on the board, which side of the T account pieces will line up on. Accounting pieces are the accounts and account types which have a normal balance lining up on the left or right side of the board, of the T account or ledger.</p><p>Once we know the normal balance of accounts, we will play the accounting game by applying debits and credits to the accounts following a set of rules which have a particular objective, the creation of relevant information, the creation of financial statements.</p><p><strong>The major obstacles for learning accounting are the same as those for learning music.</strong></p><p>The primary obstacle to learning accounting concepts is the memorization of rules, a simple task, but one most do not find very enjoyable.</p><p>Memorizing rules is the same obstacle holding people back from learning many fulfilling activities, activities like learning music, or a new language. Rules of some kind must be learned to play music. The idea of rules, of structure, of constraints, seems counter-intuitive to the concept of creativity we associate with creating and playing music, but rules, structure, and limitations are often requirements for creativity. For example, writing and especially poetry, requires adherence to strict rules and many great writers have done their best work while constrained by deadlines and editors.</p><p>Whether it be notes, chords, or songs rote memorization is required before these learned concepts can be used to create something new, to create or play music, the structure critically contributing to the creation process. Creating, of course, is the fun part, the fulfilling part, the area to look forward to but memorization is a necessary part, a critical part, and a part well worth the effort.</p><p><strong>Confidence in the system is required to learn accounting</strong></p><p>Education is all about asking questions, testing theories, and being skeptical of claims given without a convincing argument, without supporting facts. Accounting is no different. Questioning is essential to setting up an efficient accounting system, but the tradition of questioning can also be used as a crutch, as an excuse for not moving forward and finding our mistakes.</p><p>I recommend accounting students start out having faith that the double entry accounting system works, in a similar way that we have faith that a 1,000 piece puzzle will contain all the pieces required and can be constructed to match the picture on box, because without this confidence we will lose the motivation to move forward, to complete the task, and therefore miss out on the enjoyment of completing the project.</p><p>Confidence in the double entry accounting system is necessary when first learning accounting concepts because doubting the system restricts us from moving forward to complete the necessary steps and look for the mistakes we have made. It is much easier to claim that the system does not work then look for the more likely problem, our own errors.</p><p>Having faith in a system does not mean we should not question a system. Questions are always encouraged, at all times, but it is best to give the concepts the benefit of the doubt and not allow our questioning of the system to be an excuse, a crutch, for not completing a task or figuring out a problem.</p><p>The double entry accounting system has been around for a long time, at least since the Franciscan monk Luca Pacioli around 1494, and while this does not prove its correctness it does show that it has been a useful tool to many in the past, and will therefore likely be a useful tool to many in the future.</p><p>Accounting is divided into two major groups; Financial Accounting &amp; Managerial Accounting.</p><p><strong>Financial accounting </strong>has the end goal of generating financial statements, financial statements designed with external user needs in mind. The aim of financial accounting toward external users may seem strange at first because financial data is required and used for internal, managerial, decision making as well but external users have needs that require more reliance on financial statements in many ways.</p><p><strong>External users</strong> are users outside the company and include investors, creditors, the internal revenues service, and customers. Companies need these external users for things such as investments, loans, and to follow laws and regulations.</p><p>External users do not have intimate knowledge of the business and therefore need assurance to increase the level of trust, trust being a necessary component for business transactions to take place. To increase confidence levels, financial statements are required to follow a strict format of rules designed to standardize the financial reporting. Standardization allows for the comparison of financial information across time and between different companies.</p><p><strong>Managerial accounting</strong> has the goal of generating relevant information for internal decision makers to make sound decisions, for management.</p><p>Managerial accounting does include the use of the same financial information generated in financial accounting, but information is not required to be in a particular format, managerial accounting being less regulated. Management has intimate knowledge of the company, and therefore there is less need for regulations on the format of data and information. Management will determine the best format for managerial statements to assist in making the best decisions.</p><p>Because managerial accounting is less regulated, it is commonly thought that managerial accounting will differ greatly from organization to organization. While it is true that managerial accounting practices will vary from company to company, there are also best practices which are applied, practices that have stood the test of time, those that have helped good companies be great. The study of managerial accounting is the study of best practices used to make good business decisions.</p><p>Financial accounting developed in much the same way, businesses looking for best practices to compile data for both themselves and external users. Over time financial accounting has solidified those best practices into a standardized form. Standardization often limits innovation but does provide a clear format for external users, this being one of the tradeoffs related to regulation. We will talk more about the need for standardization in a profession like accounting when we discuss what a profession is and the need for ethics and regulations within a profession.</p><p>Ethics plays a huge role in accounting as it does in most professions, in part, because ethics deals with trust and trust is an essential component of any business transaction. The concept of ethics is very broad, has been studied intensely since ancient times, and is an area which still has many open questions, but ethics related to accounting can be narrowed from the broader discussion in some ways.</p><p>One way to think of ethics as it relates to a profession is by implementing a kind of categorical imperative, acting in a way that we would wish to be universal for the entire profession. For example, stealing could benefit an individual but if everyone steals everyone is worse off and therefore stealing would be wrong.</p><p>Similarly acting in a way that is misleading could lead to gains for an individual but doing so harms the profession and is therefore wrong. Most professions can apply a concept like this. two of the oldest professions are law and medicine. The reason professions are needed in areas like law, medicine, and accounting is because they deal with specialized knowledge, knowledge most people do not have and that many are dependent on at some point in their lives. An uneven distribution of knowledge can cause incentives for individuals to seek short term gains through deceit.</p><p>For example, somebody claiming to know medicine could administer medicine that is not effective and the patient would not know, a patient having no choice but to trust the expertise of the doctor. If a physician abuses trust by administering remedies that are not effective, they are profiting off the name of the profession, from the brand of the occupation, and if this practice is done enough, it will result in a lack of trust in medicine.</p><p>A similar scenario can be painted for many areas of accounting, accounting having advanced to a specialized field, one that most do not understand, but are forced to deal in at some point or another. The need for trust drives and incentivizes a profession to self-regulate, to build a brand. One way the accounting profession self-regulates is by requiring different certifications to practice in different areas, certifications like a certified public accountant CPA license. A certification process helps provide the public with a level of trust that an individual has some basic understanding of concepts they are dealing with and provides ethical standards that must be met.</p><p>An example of the need for trust in accounting is when investors use financial statements to make investment decisions. Publicly traded stocks have an increased need for transparency in their financial reporting because their stock is being sold and traded by the public, a huge benefit to both companies and investors, providing capital to companies, and opportunities for gain to investors.</p><p>For an individual to invest, however, they need to analyze their options, and financial statements are the primary tool for this analysis. If investors do not have confidence in the numbers reported on the financial statements, do not understand how the numbers are reported, or cannot compare the numbers to related companies, investment transactions will decline due to a lack of information and trust.</p><p>The economy needs trust in the system as a major component which keeps interactions taking place, compelling people to take calculated risks, driving individuals to do business and drive growth and innovation.</p><p>Fraud is one component in the discussion of ethics, fraud being the deliberate attempt to deceive for personal gain. Fraud can take many forms in business from theft to falsifying the financial statements to drive up stock prices and increase bonus pay.</p><p>Most people believe fraud is all about employing the right people, honest people, those with integrity. While the right people is a huge component, it is not the only one. Good people in a bad environment or culture can fall victim to the group mentality. Businesses can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing conditions that foster fraud and taking active steps in reducing them.</p><p>A criminologist has introduced the idea of a <strong>fraud triangle</strong>, consisting of three factors which increase the likelihood of fraud. <strong>Fraud factors</strong> include <strong>opportunity</strong>, <strong>pressure</strong>, and <strong>rationalization</strong>.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong> means that the ability to commit fraud and not be caught is present, or at least perceived. For example, if a company had a policy of keeping their petty cash fund in a shoebox in the middle of the lunch room the opportunity for theft without detection would be greater than if the money was put into a more secure location.</p><p><strong>Pressure</strong> or incentive means that a person is under pressure of some kind, often financial. If money if tight the likelihood of an individual committing fraud is significantly increased.</p><p><strong>Rationalization </strong>is when a person justifies an action. Our minds are excellent at rationalizing. We generally believe that we think before acting, but we often act and then justify the action through rationalization. Rationalization is one reason fraud tends to continue, and even escalate over time.</p><p>For example, if a company left the petty cash in the lunchroom an employee may rationalize theft by reasoning that it\u2019s the company\u2019s fault for not better safeguarding their assets. While it may be true that leaving cash in the middle of the lunchroom is not a good internal control for a company, it is not a justification for theft. Another common rationalization is that a company is vast and rich while an employee may feel small and poor and taking to from the rich to give to the poor is not bad. Again, there may be some truth to this statement, but it is not a reason justifying theft.</p><p>Companies can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing these fraud factors and taking active steps to reduce them, steps including internal controls. For example, companies should safeguard assets and should create a culture of honesty, communication, and respect, a culture that needs to be demonstrated from the top down. If the culture is bad at the top good employees will not be able to pull up the culture from the bottom.</p><p><strong>Objectivity \u2013 </strong>To provide information useful to investors creditors, and others. The concept of objectivity seems obvious, but we always need to keep the end goal in mind, the creation of useful information for external users. Financial accounting is aimed at producing useful information for external users like investors, creditors, and customers, the format of this information usually being financial statements. By anticipating the needs of external users, we can set rules and guidelines to provide the most value.</p><p><strong>Qualitative Characteristics</strong> \u2013 To require information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable. The characteristics of relevance, reliability, and comparability are related to the objective of providing useful information because external users will value these features.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Relevant</strong> means the information is relevant or necessary to the needs of the users. Relevant information could be information that influences the decision-making process. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements to assess the likelihood of a business\u2019s ability to pay the loan back in the future.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Reliable</strong> means that the information must be trusted or must be believed that it is free of material errors and is presented in a fair way. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements and want assurance that they can be trusted. Part of the assurance requirement may be that the financial statements are presented in a standardized form, following a standardized set of rules. A bank may also ask for a third-party review or audit to add to the level of reliability.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Comparability </strong>means that financial information needs to be comparable to prior periods and other companies. Comparability requires standardization, a systematic way of compiling data from one time to the next. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may want to compare financial</p><p>statement performance with prior years to see if there has been an improvement and to compare financial statements to other businesses in the industry. For comparisons of financial statements to be relevant, there needs to be conformity in presentation.</p><p><strong>Going-concern assumption - </strong>the presumption that the business will continue operating instead of being closed. We assume a business is in business to stay in business, to have an objective of revenue generation and growth. If a business is planning on stopping business or is going bankrupt their behavior is likely to be much different than if they planned on continuing business. A business that is not a going concern, one that plans on stopping operations, needs to disclose this information to the readers of their financial statements so that readers can change their default assumption that the business will remain in business.</p><p><strong>Separate business entity assumption -</strong> means that the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction. Every transaction will have a reason and we need to determine if the reason is business or personal in nature.</p><p>The business objective is revenue generation. A business\u2019s mission statement will define what a business does to generate revenue, but from an accounting standpoint, the objective of revenue generation will help guide business actions and help us categorize transactions as either business or personal.</p><p>Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction. Every transaction will have a reason and we need to determine if the reason is business or personal in nature.</p><p>The business objective is revenue generation. A business\u2019s mission statement will define what a business does to generate revenue, but from an accounting standpoint, the objective of revenue generation will help guide business actions and help us categorize transactions as either business or personal.</p><p>Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the more specific objective of revenue generation, the transaction is a personal one.</p><p>An example of separating business and personal objectives is the creation of a separate business checking account, a separate account allowing us to track the business revenue and expenditures more quickly, most deposits into the business checking account being revenue and most withdrawals being expenses.</p><p>The difference between a business expense and a personal expense is the objective for the expense. For example, if we went out to dinner the cost of the meal may be business or personal depending on the objective. If we took clients to dinner to pick up new business engagements, the meal would be a business expense and if we took our family out to dinner to have fun and live well it would be a personal expense.</p><p>In a similar way as expenses can be either business or personal, assets can also be either business or personal in nature. For example, if we purchase a building with the intention of making widgets for sale the building would be an asset rather than an expense because it will help generate revenue in the future and has not yet been consumed. On the other hand, if we purchase a building to live in as a home it would be a personal asset, the objective being to live well.</p><p>We can think of many areas where business and personal objectives overlap, areas were categorizing the transaction is difficult. For example, we may take both family and clients to dinner or we may work from our home. As accountants, our job is to differentiate the business and personal portion as much as possible to better measure our performance.</p><p>Our business objectives can be thought of as fitting inside our larger personal objectives, the generation of revenue being part of our larger personal goals of living well.</p><p>As the business grows and achieves the business objective of revenue generation owners can begin taking money and resources out of the business to be used for their larger personal objectives of living well.</p><p>\u201cGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are uniform minimum standards of, and guidelines to, financial accounting and reporting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) are authorized to establish these principles.\u201d (AICPA, n.d.)</p><p>Financial Accounting strives to generate financial information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable because these characteristics create value to users of financial reports, particularly to external users of financial reports.</p><p>Creating and implementing standard guidelines for the processing and reporting of financial statements makes the financial statements more relevant, reliable, and comparable. Standards help to standardize financial reporting, making financial statements comparable across time and to other companies.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has authority to set Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and the SEC has delegated much of the responsibilities of setting GAAP to the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. The SEC is a governmental agency, and the FASB is a private sector group. The system of delegating authority to a private sector group makes sense because the accounting profession, like any profession, has an incentive to self-regulate and has a better understanding of the problems within the profession and how best to address them.</p><p>There are many useful ways to separate and categorize business entities, one being by business form, by type of business structure; another being by a business's relation to inventory, whether the business is selling inventory and whether they produce the inventory they are selling.</p><p>The three broad categories of business structure are a sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.</p><p>A <strong>sole proprietorship</strong> is a business owned by one person and is the most common type of business in the United States. The benefits of a sole proprietorship are that they are easy and inexpensive to form. An individual who starts acting as a business, generating revenue, is a sole proprietor by default unless they create some other type of organizations. The income from a sole proprietor is taxable but will be reported on the individual tax return, on Form 1040 supported by a supplemental Schedule C.</p><p>The disadvantages of a sole proprietor include limited personal liability protection and limited capital generation capability when compared to other types of organizations.</p><p>A <strong>partnership</strong> is similar to a sole proprietor except that the business now has two or more partners. A partnership has the same benefit of easy formation and the same drawbacks of liability exposure and limited capital generation.</p><p>A <strong>corporation</strong> is a separate legal entity. Corporations are less common than the sole proprietorship but generate the largest percentage of total U.S. revenue. The benefits of a corporation include that they provide liability protection through being a separate legal entity, the theory being that the assets of the corporation are liable but personal assets are not, personal assets having more protection when compared to other types of organizations. The disadvantages of a corporation include that they are more costly to form, more complicated to maintain, and can result in double taxation.</p><p>Much more can be said about types of entities, but this will provide a starting point. From an accounting perspective, we will start out with transactions related to a sole proprietorship and then move to a partnership and then a corporation. The reason for starting with the sole proprietorship is that it is a business form that most people can relate to and because many of the transactions found in a sole proprietorship will be the same for all entity types.</p><p>We will then move to a partnership, concentrating on the areas that are different from a sole proprietorship. Many of the transactions and processes will be the same, both entities needing to record the paying of the rent, employees, and utilities, both entities recording revenue. Transactions will differ, however, in the equity section because a partnership will have two or more owners, so the equity section is where we will spend much of our time.</p><p>We will then move to a corporation, concentrating on the areas that are different. Many transactions will remain the same, but the equity section is one area that will differ, the owners now being stockholders.</p><p>Another useful way to categorize businesses is by industry or by whether they use inventory and whether they produce inventory. A service company does not sell inventory, a merchandising business purchases and sells inventory, and a manufacturing business produces inventory to sell.</p><p>A company\u2019s relationship with inventory has a significant impact on many accounting transactions and reporting. We will start out with a service company, using similar logic as we did when starting out with a sole proprietorship. Service companies have many of the same transactions as companies that deal with inventory, but they do not need to track inventory. We will then move to merchandising companies, companies that buy and sell inventory, adding the items that are different, items related to inventory. We will then move to a manufacturing companies, companies that produces inventory, adding things that differ, the tracking of inventory from raw materials to work in process and then to finished goods.</p><p>Generally Accepted Accounting Principle GAAP will be based on accrual concepts. The accrual basis can be compared and contrasted to a cash basis, the cash basis being a simplified method, one which does not provide information as useful, as relevant, or as accurate as an accrual method.</p><p><strong>Cash basis</strong> \u2013 Records revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. A cash basis is not the basis required by GAAP, GAAP rules following an accrual basis, but understanding a cash basis helps in understanding both how an accrual basis works and the reasons for it. Cash and revenue are not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when revenue will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash collection does not always equal the exact location in time of revenue earnings but is often close enough.</p><p>In a similar way as revenue being recorded when cash is received under a cash basis, expenses are recorded when cash is paid under a cash basis. Cash and expenses are also not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when expenses will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash payment does not always equal the exact location in time expenses were incurred but is often close enough.</p><p>Very few businesses use a pure cash basis because there are times when the smoke is not close to the fire, times when revenue is not close to cash collection, and times when expense incursion is not close to cash payment. For example, almost any business would recognize a cash payment of $100,000 for a building as an asset of a building rather than an expense of building expense even though cash is paid. The reason a building is recorded as an asset is that the asset has not yet been consumed, has not yet been used to generate revenue.</p><p><strong>Accrual basis</strong> \u2013 is driven by two main principles, the revenue recognition principle and the matching principle. Revenue recognition deals with the time to recognize revenue and the matching principle deals with the time to record expenses.</p><p>The revenue recognition principle records revenue when the revenue is earned, a time which is not always the same as when revenue is paid. Finding the exact time that revenue has been earned is not always easy but is usually when the job has been completed. For example, the time when revenue has been earned for a service company is when the job has been completed, when the service is done, and the time when revenue has been earned for a merchandising company is when inventory is delivered to the customer. An accrual method is closer to a firefighter using a GPS system to pinpoint the exact location of a fire rather than just estimating the location by following the smoke.</p><p>For example, a food truck may have a policy of only accepting cash for food. The policy of accepting cash as the only form of payment means the time cash is received and the time work is done will be the same. Therefore, both a cash method and an accrual method will result in the same journal entry but for different reasons, the cash method being driven by the cash received, the accrual method being driven by the earnings of the income, by the delivery of the food.</p><p>A bookkeeping business, on the other hand, will often need to perform work, invoice the client on completion of the work, expecting a check in the mail sometime in the future. The revenue recognition principle would require revenue to be recognized at the time the work was done, often when the invoice was generated and not when cash was received. We will cover the format of these transactions a little later but for now, recognize that revenue is the act of earning revenue which is different from receiving cash, cash usually being the form of payment for revenue earned. There are other forms of payment, including trade or barter, but cash is the most common form of payment. The revenue recognition principle is similar to how most of us think of our paychecks when working for a company. A business may pay employees every other week, but an employee has earned the revenue in the week the work was done. The company is expected to pay the employee for work done even if the employee leaves the company. For example, if an employee earned wages of $1,000 last week according to their employment agreement and employment is terminated this week the employee will still expect payment of $1,000 for the work performed last week, for revenue that was earned by the employee last week even though cash had not yet been received.</p><p>It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received. For example, a newspaper company will collect money before doing the work, before delivering newspapers. A newspaper company will often collect money for a year\u2019s subscription and then earn the revenue by delivering the newspapers in the future. Under an accrual method the newspaper company will have to wait on recording revenue until they earn the revenue by doing work, by delivering the papers, even though they already have the cash in hand. Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those </p><p>Click Here</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received.

Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those future sales and if they do not deliver the newspapers in the future they will owe the money back.</p><p>As mentioned earlier there are many ways the double entry accounting system can be expressed including the use of an accounting equation, debits and credits, and a balance sheet. We will focus on the accounting equations in this section. The benefits of an accounting equation include the use of a simple formula, simple math that can be explained and understood. Transactions will be described using the symmetry of the accounting equation. The problem with using the accounting equation to record transactions and build the financial statements is that it is not as efficient as the use of debits and credits. We will learn the balancing concept using the accounting equation, but as we do, keep in mind that the accounting equation is not the whole story, that we will need to understand new concepts, the concepts of debits and credits, to record data with which to generate financial statements well.</p><p>The accounting equation is:</p><p><strong>Asset = Liabilities + Equity</strong></p><p>The format above is the most common form of the accounting equation for financial accounting because the left side of the equation shows what the business owns and the right side shows who it is owed to, either a third-party liability or the owner. Recall our separate business entity assumption while considering the accounting equation. Thinking of the business as a separate entity helps to understand the accounting equation, the left side of the equal sign showing what the separate entity owns, the right showing who has claim to what the separate entity owns.</p><p>Because the accounting equation is a formula it can be expressed at least two other ways. A second way to write the equation is:</p><p><strong>Assets \u2013 Liabilities = Equity</strong></p><p>The format of the accounting equation above is useful because it emphasizes that equity is the book value of the company, the amount left over after subtracting liabilities from assets, an amount which can also be called net assets. To understand the meaning of equity we can consider the liquidation of a company, the selling of assets for cash, the payment of liabilities owed, and the leftover cash which would then be available to the owner, this amount being equal to equity if assets were sold at book value. Note that all assets will not be sold for the exact amount reported when a business is sold. For example, an asset of equipment valued at $50,000 may not be sold for $50,000 in a free market, possibly being sold for something less like $40,000 or something more like $60,000. We will discuss this more at a later time. For now, remember that equity represents net assets on a book value basis, assets minus liabilities. </p><p>A third way to write the accounting equation is:</p><p><strong>Assets \u2013 Equity = Liabilities</strong></p><p>This format of the accounting equation is not as useful but is another way the accounting equation can be expressed algebraically.</p><p>Account types include assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. Recognize that account types are not the same thing as actual accounts, each account type having multiple accounts falling into the category. Understanding account types and the accounts that fall into each account type category is essential to the accounting process.</p><p><strong>Assets</strong> are resources owned by the business. The most common asset is cash, but assets also include accounts receivable, prepayments, land, building, and equipment. Assets are items that have not yet been consumed, resources planned to be used in the future to achieve business goals, to help generate revenue.</p><p><strong>Liabilities</strong> are claims by creditors. Liabilities come about from a transaction that happens in the past which obligates the company for some form of future payment. Purchasing something on a credit card is an example of how a liability can be created, the transaction creating a future obligation to pay cash. Liability accounts include accounts payable, notes payable, and bonds payable.</p><p><strong>Equity</strong> is the owner\u2019s claim to assets. Equity is equal to assets minus liabilities. Equity is often the most confusing section of the accounting equation, in part, because different organization types will organize the equity section differently and because the equity section is involved in the closing process of temporary accounts.</p><p>The equity section represents what is owed to the owner on a book basis. This is best illustrated by imagining we liquidate or close a business, selling the assets for cash, and then paying off the liabilities. The money left over would be equal to the equity section if all sales were made on a book value basis.</p><p>The equity section for a sole proprietor will be called owner\u2019s equity and consist of one capital account. The equity section of a partnership will be called partnership equity and consist of two or more owners and therefore two or more capital accounts. The equity section of a corporation will be called shareholder\u2019s equity, shareholders being the owners of a corporation, and will included capital stock and retained earnings. Although the format changes the equity section taken as a whole can still be thought of as what is owed to the owner or owners in each case.</p><p>When thinking about the accounting equation, the equity section includes all temporary accounts, including revenue accounts and expense accounts.</p><p><strong>Revenue - </strong>is income generated from performing work. Revenue is not the same thing as cash. Cash is a form of payment while revenue represents the creation of value and the earning of compensation. Revenue is a timing account, needing to be measured over a time frame, a starting and ending point. For example, when somebody says they earn $100,000 the concept has no meaning unless we assign a time frame, most people naturally attributing a year as the time frame when hearing a number like $100,000. A different time frame would have a much different meaning. For example, revenue of $100,000 a month is much different than revenue of $100,000 a year.</p><p>We can contrast temporary accounts, like revenue and expense accounts, with permanent accounts like cash. Saying we have $100,000 cash does not require a time frame to define what we mean because cash is a permanent account, representing a position at a point in time.</p><p><strong>Expense</strong> is the using of assets or incurrence of liabilities as part of operations to generate revenue. Expenses are what a business needs to consume to achieve the goal of revenue generation. Expenses are also temporary accounts needing a beginning and ending time.</p><p>There are usually many more expense accounts then revenue accounts, but we hope the revenue accounts add up to a greater dollar amount. The reason there are more expense accounts then revenue accounts is because of specialization, companies focusing on earning money by doing what they do best and paying for their other needs.</p><p>Before we demonstrate common transactions and how they are analyzed using the accounting equating we will cover transaction rules. Applying a process for recording transactions will reduce the likelihood of making bad assumptions and learning rules that do not apply in all cases.</p><p>It is possible to learn rules that apply in only some cases, requiring the unlearning of these rules when we move to cases where they do not apply. Learning rules that do not apply in all cases should be avoided because unlearning rules in cases where a bad rule does not apply is tough.</p><p>Learning and applying the steps below for recording transactions helps avoid problems, eliminating the need to unlearn false concepts in the future. These same rules will apply when we move to learning debits and credits at which time we will build on these rules, applying more concepts to the balancing ideas developed here.</p><p><strong>Transaction Rules:</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Every transaction will affect at least two accounts.</p><p>\u00b7 Every transaction will keep the accounting equation in balance.</p><p>Transaction thought process</p><p>When first learning transactions we will repeat this thought process for each transaction, the thought process being designed to make the recording of transactions as easy as possible, and avoid learning rules that are not always applicable. This process will make more sense as we work through transactions. Working transactions is the only way to understand the double entry accounting system fully.</p><p>We will now go through common financial transactions, transactions needed by most any business, and analyze them using the accounting equation and our set of rules and thought processes.</p><p>We will start off looking at transactions involving cash, cash being the most common account affected. Understanding how cash is affected will act like an add, or crutch, when considering the other account or accounts effected in the transaction.</p><p>First, imagine a situation where the cash goes up because the company received cash, and consider possibilities for the other account affected.</p><p>We know that at least one other account will be effect and that the accounting equation must remain in balance. If there is only one other account effected we are left with just three possibilities to keep the accounting equation in balance. Either the liabilities went up, equity went up, or another asset account also went down. Below are examples of each.</p><p>If cash went up because of a business receiving a bank loan, then liabilities would also go up, keeping the accounting equation in balance.</p><p>If cash went goes up do to collecting cash for work the company did then revenue or income would also go up, revenue being part of equity.</p><p>If cash went up because we are receiving money for work done in the past we would also reduce the accounts receivable account, an asset account representing money owed to the company for past work completed.</p><p>It is possible to use an expanded accounting equation, listing all accounts under each account type, forming a kind of trial balance which can be used to create the financial statements. We will not be using this format here because it is not an efficient way to generate financial statements and gives the impression that debits and credits are not needed, which is not a good impression to give.</p><p>To understand double entry accounting and how financial statements are created, the accounting equation is not sufficient, and debits and credit will be needed. We will introduce how debits and credits work later, but the concepts will build on the concepts we learn here working with the accounting equation.</p><p>Below are more common transaction and the effect on the accounting equation:</p><p><strong>Owner invests cash into the business:</strong></p><p>The asset account of cash goes up as well as equity, the amount owed to the owner. Equity goes up because the business basically owes the cash back to the owner. When investing cash into a business, an owner is hoping to receive a return on investment and be able to withdraw cash from the business in the future, to be used for personal use.</p><p><strong>Purchase of supplies for cash:</strong></p><p>The asset of cash goes down, but another asset of supplies goes up, the net result being no change in any account type of the account equation. The result of a transaction with no change to the accounting equation is one reason debits and credits are a more efficient way to record transactions then the use of the accounting equation. We will record much the same transaction using debits and credits later.</p><p>The increase in supplies is an increase in an asset type account rather than an expense type account, expenses being part of equity, because of the accrual accounting principle of matching. When the supplies are purchased, they have not yet been used to help generate revenue but will help to generate revenue in the future. Supplies will be expensed in the time they are used or consumed to help generate revenue.</p><p>Supplies will be our introduction to an inventory system because supplies will be tracked in a similar way as inventory. The recording of supplies will start with reporting supplies as an asset, followed by the counting of supplies at end of a time period, like a month, to determine how much has been used, and then the recording of the decrease is the supplies asset account and recording of the supplies utilized in the supplies expense account.</p><p>Supplies may be expenses when purchased if the amount is not material, not significant to decision making, because expensing the supplies is an easier process than capitalizing as an asset when the amount is not significant to decision making. For example, if we purchased two years\u2019 worth of paper-clips for $100 we may just expense the purchase because the cost of $100 is not significant to decision making, $100 not being an amount that will impact financial statement user choices.</p><p><strong>Purchase Supplies on Account \u2013 No Cash:</strong></p><p>Because no cash is effected, we will first consider what is received, that being supplies in this case. The asset account of supplies will go up, and the liability account of accounts payable will go up. The accounts payable account is like a credit card account, going up when we purchase on account and going down when we pay off the balance owed.</p><p><strong>Pay Cash for Telephone Service:</strong></p><p>The asset account of cash will go down and the expense account of telephone expense will go up, bringing equity down. Expense accounts can be confusing when considering the effect on the accounting equation because expense accounts are temporary accounts and are part of the equity section of the accounting equation. Expenses represent the consumption of assets or the incursion of liabilities to help generate revenue. Assets consumed or liabilities incurred to help generate revenue will bring down equity, equity calculated as assets minus liabilities.</p><p><strong>Completed Work on Account \u2013 No cash received:</strong></p><p>If no cash is effected, we will consider what was received, that being an \u201cI owe you\u201d from a customer in this case. An asset of an \u201cI owe you\u201d from a customer seems strange at first, a promised payment not being tangible, but a promise to pay does have value even though there is a chance it will not ever be received. Accounts receivable is the account representing an \u201cI owe you\u201d from customers, an asset account showing value due for work done.</p><p>The asset of accounts receivable will go up, and revenue or income will go up, increasing the equity section of the accounting equation. Revenue is a temporary account representing income that has been earned, and temporary accounts are part of the equity section.</p><p><strong>Payment for Amount Owed for Past Transaction:</strong></p><p>Cash will go down, and liabilities will go down. Paying cash for a transaction that happened in the past, for value received in the past, means we are paying off a liability, like paying off a credit card. Accounts payable is the most common liability account for most companies, representing what is owed to third-party vendors. When we pay off a balance that is due the liability account of accounts payable will go down.</p><p>Financial statements are the end goal of financial accounting, the final product most useful to external users like investors, creditors, and customers. Financial statements include the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of equity, and the statement of cash flows. We will concentrate on the first three statements here and move to the statement of cash flows later.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2019-08-17_00-59-35-eb6caee36f3fdb232c6d851838ebd033/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637496692&Signature=CQeFfjB1tgEQd8mL14J1wX0PSw~49gkf14XdHK5SyU8Qa05IOsvdJLgkg32lMDyF72xOqwiOQXZVgqNiLVfJAZ-roszcuoY2QEuPJQC7MC4uJBPVEHHpUJvuWAf6uvsW5ILwE87J6W-tIvqd-~BARp~0jq1Vh9hIw~fl8JT9P0l9Yk24fe5vDe1ngJmf3CuAjHt60ub~RstdM3IBsZ0wFogLZrhq~cTxVGTiMXNs-J~M4wPMgvceH7Dcy263RTa6GaRtfz3~9eyhM7TzTCsMsTQMgzIZEjOJ~dbfJqJg2zHPJZY2qbCblcD6lSf0nIyxnVTK2TzD5sZBEcF7Oe2NYQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3378022", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Python And Flask Framework Complete Course For Beginners", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Horizon Tech", "duration": "12.5 hours", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "660", "students": "153036", "coupon_code": "857B725C092BC5170897", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3378022_637b.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-beginners-course-/?couponCode=857B725C092BC5170897", "end_day": "2021-11-26 01:42:51+00:00", "headline": "Beginner to Expert Python And Flask.Start from the basics and go all the way to creating your own applications and games", "description": "<p>Learn Python From Scratch</p><ul><li><p> I\u2019ve created thorough, extensive, but easy to follow content which you\u2019ll easily understand and absorb.</p><p> The course starts with the basics, including Python fundamentals, programming, and user interaction.</p><p><br></p><p>The curriculum is going to be very hands-on as we walk you from start to finish becoming a professional Python developer.

It is easy to use and rich with various libraries and functions required to perform various Data Science and Machine Learning activities. In addition, it is the most widely used and automated language for the use of many Deep Learning frameworks including Tensorflow and Keras.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Advanced Mathematics Learning Machine</p><p><br></p><p>Mathematics is the foundation of Data Science in general and Learning Machines in particular. Without understanding the meanings of Vectors, Matrices, their operations and understanding Calculus, it is impossible to understand the basics of Data Science and Machine Learning. The Gradient Declaration of Basic Neural Network and Mechanical Learning is built on the foundations of Calculus and Derivatives.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Previous Statistics for Data Science</p><p><br></p><p>It is not enough to know only what you are saying, in the middle, the mode, etc. Advanced Techniques for Science and Mechanical Data such as feature selection, size reduction using PCA are all based on previous Distribution and Statistical Significance calculations.

Data identification is one of the most important methods of Data Science and Mechanical Data and is used for Analytical Data Analysis. In that, we analyze the data visually to identify patterns and styles. We will learn how to create different sites and charts and how to analyze them for all practical purposes. Feature Selection plays an important role in Machine Learning and Visualization Data is its key.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Data processing</p><p><br></p><p>Scientific Data requires extensive data processing. Data Science and Machine Learning specialists spend more than 2/3 of their time analyzing and analyzing data. Data can be noisy and never in good condition. Data processing is one of the most important ways for Data Science and Mechanics to learn to get the best results.

Current students will have access to the updates as they are created.</strong></p><p><strong>How can I get access to the software?</strong></p><p><strong>If you do not have access to QuickBooks, Intuit, the owner of QuickBooks, often provides a free 30-day trial, perfect for our needs.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Try typing into your favorite browser: Download a trial of QuickBooks Desktop</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Students at accredited educational institutions may be able to get access to a trial version that lasts a year rather than 30 days. Try typing into your favorite browser: QuickBooks Desktop for Students </strong></p></li></ul><p>QuickBooks updates the software each year and we updated the course content each year, so you have the latest look and feel of the software.</p><p>One benefit of QuickBooks Desktop is that you can use the same software for multiple years. Therefore, you may have an older version of the software or may work with a client using an older version of the software.</p><p>Along with the most current software, this course will also include demonstrations in older versions of the software so that users can refer them when needed. We will also provide backup files related to older versions of the software that can be used to work through practice problems.</p><p>Note that there are some drawbacks to updating the course each year we want to be upfront about. We think the benefits outweigh the problems.</p><p>The course can feel bloated with content as we work similar demonstrations in new versions of the software. We will add the new content to the top of the course so you can jump right into the newest version. Each version of the software will include at least 25 hours of content once completed which makes it one of the most comprehensive courses you will find.</p><p>Adding new counted each year also makes it a little more difficult to fulfill the requirements for Udemy to provide a certificate of completion. However, you do not need to watch each video to receive the certificate of completion. Once you have finished the portion of the course that relates to you, the rest of the videos can be marked as completed manually, allowing Udemy to issue the certificate of completion.</p><p>This course will start at the basics, assuming you know nothing about the software or accounting.</p><p>We will start by comparing the different versions of QuickBooks. We will then go through the purchasing process, the downloading process, and the installation process.</p><p>The first half of the course will be dedicated to navigating the software, getting a feel for the major components of the software, and the primary accounting cycles such as the customer section or revenue cycle, the vendor section or payments cycle, and the employee section or payroll cycle.</p><p>Once we learn the primary sections or accounting cycles we will analyze the forms and transactions within each section, considering the impact each has on the financial statements.</p><p>The second half of the course will be in the format of a comprehensive problem, working through two months of data impute.</p><p>We will enter every standard type of transaction as we work through the comprehensive problem. The comprehensive problem format will provide context to the data entry process, so we understand how the data impute fits into the accounting workflow.</p><p>A comprehensive problem also allows us to do more than simple data entry, data entry generally being the easiest part of the accounting process. We will be able to see how to set up the system to make the data entry as easy as possible.</p><p>We will also be able to see the impact on the financial statements of every transaction we make and be able to check our work after each transaction.</p><p>QuickBooks backup files will be provided. Backup files allow us to restore a data file and are very useful for learning. Backup files permit us to jump forward in a practice problem and have the data needed to work along with the step by step presentations, having the same data as is in the example presentation, in our system as we start the practice problem. Backup files also allow us to rework a problem or start over if we make an error.</p><p>If a course teaches in the form of a comprehensive problem, the best way to teach, and they do not provide backup files you will need to start the problem with no data and then follow the entire problem without any errors to line up with each step of the example problem being presented. Backup files allow you much more flexibility, being able to jump to future parts of the practice problem or rework any part of the problem.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-09-15_01-34-25-4652e2888c5dbee4f405be6132694d23/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637496732&Signature=hPAoyOg30OZqZhGduvr~u~uGpbjwvfCjN92bcprULEkhS1zlb2SA8Pb83BpVENEqEet4u5eY-lZB2OoxTzZ8JzJezJFTCX~Rx0KFnCQkCn3Z7U7b7oRPSBGuleOztIOYa02LRp~XaVRM1~zkGn87zyX-PrsZTm0IjF8-B~YQoZlmdU56IvYrS4GXxbudJlMbLfS4t9u0CEI9gWzIjLZdJ9HNIWIPzWPMf0DxlX-q-zWVdJ~DzAL2htCHUzR-oN7AIAvMfcj9SBK7ze7AzjttFLRe5dCn-fT2I0l39vUEDFI6wikS9gdPDCpuecY6faZWVdtIuXVz-YuiAPtIRLFWLg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "1050278", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Other Business", "title": "Membership Site: Membership Recurring Home Business Model", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "OMG - Mastermind", "duration": "2.5 hours", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "69", "students": "32914", "coupon_code": "222625F90280CD4C4415", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1050278_8ce5_2.jpg?secure=8C1SMy7_2vMARtgg9l4xUA%3D%3D%2C1637566934", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/membership-empire-recurring-home-business-model/?couponCode=222625F90280CD4C4415", "end_day": "2021-11-22 06:02:53+00:00", "headline": "Beginners Guide on How To Start Your Membership Site Business And Get Monthly Payments Through Membership Website", "description": "<p><strong>Two Certificates for the Price of One! Finish your Udemy course and Contact us to get your Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Certificate!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Membership Sites Are Perfect For Passive Income?</strong><br></p><p>If you\u2019re interested in making money online, then it\u2019s probably because you&nbsp;like the idea of having more freedom to live and work wherever and&nbsp;however you want. The benefits of working online are many and varied and\nextend into every aspect of your life.</p><p>But in order for you to make the very most from this way of working, you&nbsp;also need to make sure you choose the perfect business model. Working&nbsp;online on its own does not necessarily equate to an ideal lifestyle; rather\nthe benefits come when you work online in the right way. And let me tell&nbsp;you: creating a membership site is definitely the right way.</p><p> Working online is easy. If you are in a job that\u2019s fairly flexible, then you&nbsp;should be able to ask your employer if you can work from home and simply&nbsp;log into the company\u2019s network whenever you start working. And sure, this will bring some benefits: you\u2019ll be able to stay in bed longer and stop commuting and you\u2019ll have the luxury of&nbsp;being able to drink tea, listen to&nbsp;music and generally create a comfortable environment.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>But you\u2019re still ultimately a slave to your job. You\u2019re still trading \u2018time for&nbsp;hours\u2019 and you\u2019ll still need to be available for the hours between 9am-5pm. </p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019ll probably also need to be near the phone and you\u2019ll be expected to&nbsp;output a certain amount of work every day. That means you probably can\u2019t&nbsp;leave the house and work outdoors in case you lose your internet&nbsp;connection. And it means you can decide to stop working for the day and&nbsp;visit a friend instead. Worst of all, you can still be \u2018told off\u2019 by your boss \u2013&nbsp;reprimanded like a child! </p><p><br></p><p>The same goes for creating your own online business. If you\u2019re a web&nbsp;designer for example, then you have the freedom to decide when you work&nbsp;on projects. But you probably still have deadlines and to all extents and&nbsp;purposes, your clients are your bosses. If you fail to complete </p><p> </p><p>This is why so many people find the idea of blogging desirable. All you&nbsp;have to do is to create and manage a website that you hopefully find&nbsp;fascinating and really enjoy writing about. You\u2019ll get to experience a lot of the satisfaction that comes from running your own business. And you get&nbsp;passive income, meaning that you\u2019ll earn money while you sleep.&nbsp;But even this isn\u2019t perfect. Because one day, you might earn $200 and the&nbsp;next day you might earn $10.</p><p>\nIt only takes a change to Google\u2019s search algorithm and you can lose all of&nbsp;your progress. What\u2019s more, is that it takes actually a huge amount of time&nbsp;to build up the amount of traffic that you need to make a big profit from a&nbsp;blog. This is especially true if you are planning to use pay-per-click&nbsp;advertising but it\u2019s equally the case if you are selling your own product.</p><p>\nThink about it: how often do you click ads on other websites? This is why it&nbsp;typically takes 1K visitors for you to generate just one or two clicks and the&nbsp;same goes for sales of products. It\u2019s a huge amount of work before you&nbsp;start earning anything and there\u2019s no guarantee it will ever get to the point&nbsp;where it can provide a livable salary.</p><p><br></p><p>Enter: Recurring, Passive Income</p><p>This is where membership site come in and offer an incredibly appealing alternative. Essentially, a membership website is a site that users pay to subscribe to. This normally works by first enticing the reader with some free content and showing them the kind of entertainment/information/value that you\u2019re capable of providing. Once they\u2019re hooked, you then make sure they know that they need to subscribe in order to gain access to your very best content and to get frequently updated.</p><p><br></p><p>So what\u2019s so different about this? Well for starters, it means that you can&nbsp;much more easily convert visitors to paying customers seeing as they\u2019re&nbsp;not having to put down a large amount of money and seeing as they know&nbsp;what they\u2019re getting right away.</p><p><br></p><p>More importantly, though, it means that the money is recurring and much&nbsp;more predictable. Unlike a regular blog that can very much fluctuate,&nbsp;having subscribers means you probably have some kind of agreement or&nbsp;standing order set up. This means that you can practically guarantee that&nbsp;you\u2019ll be able to earn a set amount of money each week, month or quarter.</p><p><br></p><p>And that very quickly starts to add up\u2026</p><p>So say you currently have people subscribing for $5 membership a month. If your&nbsp;content is good, then you could realistically convince one in every 1-10,000&nbsp;people to sign up. But it\u2019s very possible the very first person who visits&nbsp;might sign up! There\u2019s an element of luck but as soon as you get that first&nbsp;membership you\u2019re in business \u2013 and $5 membership a month quickly adds up to $60 a&nbsp;year.</p><p><br></p><p>Eventually, you can work whenever you like and add as much content as&nbsp;you like (we\u2019ll look at how later on) and&nbsp;still know for sure that you\u2019ll be able&nbsp;to earn X amount of money per month and per year. This is very much&nbsp;living the dream \u2013 all the freedom of passive incomes but with all the&nbsp;security of a well-paid job!</p><p>Can people unsubscribe? Sure they can! But the likelihood of everyone&nbsp;unsubscribing all at once is incredibly&nbsp;slim and in most cases you\u2019ll have&nbsp;more new visitors signing up than old visitors leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>What You Will Learn</p><p>This course is going to explain in great detail exactly how you go about creating your own membership website.</p><p>We\u2019ll see how to build a membership website, how to make sure that people want to subscribe, how to implement a recurring&nbsp;fee and how to thrive in this market space.</p><p>What we\u2019ll also see is that there are multiple membership business models that can work online when you know&nbsp;how.</p><p>We\u2019ll look at a selection so that you can decide on the perfect type of membership site/content for you.</p><p>Ultimately, we\u2019re going to give you the tools to take the subjects that you love and then turn them into a stable&nbsp;source of income that will pay out even while you\u2019re sleeping.</p><p>Specifically, you will learn:\n</p><p>\uf0b7 How to create a membership website or blog</p><p>\uf0b7 How to turn your site into a membership site&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to make content that will make people want to subscribe&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to promote your membership&nbsp; site&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to price your membership site&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to add extra monetization to your offering&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to create a membership app&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to create membership video&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 The importance of building a community&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to use quizzes and other forms of media&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 What you can learn from the best membership sites&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 The strategies and tools you can learn to succeed even beyond those\u2026&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 And much more!</p><p><strong>Kindly note that this is a 100% informational guide, there are no \u201cOn-Screen how to steps\u201d.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2016-12-24_12-57-42-e98998c703aed41168dcccdfc0c5da5e/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637496734&Signature=IWMy9rn7Uv1hSsASjCkEde9~qcm6~dWPSzGpCC2H9UyPrPxm12t7UjeTsnNnr4r8yU~-hH3wblCQzFt0g9UzjgJXvkWHBVbkmDoLo67QaKezKqQb7bugi9Cc5jTfBagDqn9RZ22eYzyhpOJmQBOzkHbEOonSxAPGukyg9tlW~xBGbHy7RA5uRx8eWFijIIKgaXahD2yPSVa1WVLzx4uK306ZO9DKP~rHVdvjgJGp44LbxujPNUKO2nuhLHB0MnNBGOJSj9~1drQiKfgFXvhziVsdwKeklyxJ6ZXl24Npw~H6CMO5KcGcVxRDiOhlRu1g4QMSWTvfvfTqrZAoIO167Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2733782", "category": "Photography & Video", "sub_category": "Video Design", "title": "Color Correction & Grading with Adobe Premiere Pro 2022", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "AK Media", "duration": "43 mins", "rating": "3.3", "reviews": "259", "students": "92208", "coupon_code": "C895D618FE8DC17B4028", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2733782_d23e_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/color-correction-grading-with-adobe-premiere-pro/?couponCode=C895D618FE8DC17B4028", "end_day": "2021-11-25 08:20:04+00:00", "headline": "Learn the essentials of color philosophy and perform technical color correction and grading tasks.", "description": "<p>This complete course will take you to the essentials of color correction with the Lumetri color tools inside Premiere Pro.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2019-06-18_12-59-58-03caeadbd0fd28015868d7836c8261f8/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637496738&Signature=NHBBwgPYzePV58UmLaBvIZ-Pi7wVmjom-zJKeV~AfEnEj~s3DoOgCHnjI0G6pbH~ZxrCGuGfAGp0hc1ghKzSXcJtyAl3bUany2qqMTEuldDu~Ghpt7eIg8g3SFg0FWdegBhICx3oh7WghTA02zGB2gdOTfVYDFdgrX9BT7xkOSxsgMIl42fPE7741Y7U5f2fMTkeqBDyCVYWDlAQQjs73-OeRv2izA7mOMcE69xILpT47CX69UB-Xo~-HxJpIdxnaeqmNR5lp0fm~dPkQ3kh9A4IbZSm9mIntiwS1uHAYOYkn2eCc26FNoN~S6xZoz-fsVDikodmprsXmzjoJLxsog__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3543562", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Mobile Development", "title": "Artificial Intelligence in App Creation: Beginners Edition", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "80", "students": "32371", "coupon_code": "AITHEKING", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3543562_f02d_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-in-app-creation-beginners-edition/?couponCode=AITHEKING", "end_day": "2021-11-26 05:58:30+00:00", "headline": "MBA\u00a0in\u00a0Artificial Intelligence Digital Marketing: Term 2.6 course focussed on Artificial Intelligence in App Creation", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to the sixth course in Term 2 as part of the series </em><strong><em>\"MBA in Artificial Intelligence Digital Marketing\"</em></strong>.</p><p>Today, <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning technologies </strong>are used in diverse fields as part of the daily life of large organizations across the globe. The rapid speed of AI growth demonstrates that it is a groundbreaking technology designed to transform the way people use devices and conduct business: achievements in unmanned aerial vehicles, the ability to beat people in chess and sporting games, automated customer service, and analytical systems - of course. Talking about the business, development, or marketing field, for instance, it is worth noting that Artificial Intelligence does not apply in a pure form to real self-aware intelligence machines in this sense. Instead, it can be considered a generic term for the number of software powered by automation that is being used by developers of websites and smartphone apps. They include the recognition of images and speech, cognitive computing, automated processing, and machine learning - for that matter. </p><p>Speaking of AI&nbsp;in app creation, for many years, starting with Apple's Siri, AI has already been influential in app-creation and marketing growth. It has the ability to advance even further in the coming years. Retail giants such as eBay and Amazon have already shown the ability for AI mobile applications to thrive. With new developments in technology and evolving customer expectations, the production of AI-powered mobile apps is the new digital frontier for businesses.</p><p>Further speaking, the extension of AI technology has allowed mobile users to reposition the current user experience value benchmark - altogether. Users are beginning to demand more in-depth and customized mobile app results. The output that a typical Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based app creation tool can deliver is certainly remarkable and holistic.</p><p>This course is a beginner's course that is focused on <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in App Creation</strong>.

I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction into the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\"&nbsp;</em></strong>Nick Cisik</p><p><strong><em>\"5 Stars!

You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

The MAT is an admissions exam accepted by many graduate programs in the United States. Additionally, it is used by many high-IQ societies all over the world as an admission requirement. The MAT goal is to assess logical and analytical reasoning through completion of partial analogies. The test duration is 1 hour and contains 120 questions. Exam formats include both <strong>Computer-Based Tests (CBT)</strong> and paper and pencil format.</p><p>This free practice exam features realistic questions that will help you not only review key vocabulary, but also familiarize yourself with the MAT\u2019s 120 Analogy exam format. This exam is also very good preparation for those preparing for the GRE Test, as both exams cover analogies.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>The MAT is a one hundred item, fifty minute verbal analogies test. All of the questions will be in the form of A:B:C:D. The analogies are written so that A is to B as C is to D. However, your job will be to fill in the missing term by correctly identifying the relationship that exists.</p><p><strong>Test Centers, Dates, and Fees</strong></p><p>Currently, there are more than six hundred testing centers in fifty states as well as in several foreign countries. If you live more than one hundred miles away from a designated test center, special accommodations can be made. Dates will vary by testing site, so be sure to consult with the test site. The average fee to take the MAT is about $50, though that varies by region.</p><p><strong>Scores</strong></p><p>When you register to take the MAT, you are asked to provide up to three addresses that you wish to have your score reports sent. Sending your test scores to three schools is included in the test administration fee. However, it is your responsibility to provide accurate addresses for the schools.</p><p><strong>History of the MAT</strong></p><p>According to the Miller Analogies Test Manual (1970) the test was developed to measure scholastic aptitude at the graduate school level. It is also developed to measure how well the test taker can recognize relationships between words.</p><p>Vocabulary plays a very important role on this test. Before you can correctly identify the relationship that exists between the words, you must be able to recognize and comprehend the meaning of the answer choices. Often, it is not reasoning that makes test items difficult. Rather, it is in recognizing the answer choices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Smarter not harder</em></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2410958", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "CSS & JavaScript - Certification Course for Beginners", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "duration": "3 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "1393", "students": "158887", "coupon_code": "YOUACCEL12525", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2410958_2ad5_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/css-javascript-certification-course-for-beginners/?couponCode=YOUACCEL12525", "end_day": "2021-11-25 16:10:26+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to Add Dynamic Client-Side Functions to your Web Pages using CSS & JavaScript", "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to the CSS &amp; JavaScript \u2013 Certification Course for Beginners<br><br></strong>This two part series provides a detailed overview of the fundamentals of coding using CSS and JavaScript.

Pero he amoldado un curso reducido de javascript en el primer m\u00f3dulo de este curso para que podamos realizar el juego y empezar a programar videojuegos sin haber pasado por todo el aprendizaje que conlleva un curso completo de javascript. No es el fin de este curso que el alumno se limite a aprender el javascript que doy aqu\u00ed , aprendera gran parte de javascript y de la mejor manera que es divirtiendose, pero recomiendo que siga su aprendizaje en el lenguaje para que pueda hacer lo que su imaginaci\u00f3n le permita. Entre mis cursos tengo uno de javascript bastante completo . Con lo que aprender\u00e1 aqui podr\u00e1 hacer frente al videojuego este y crear otros de funcionalidad parecida. El curso es bastante completo ,no nos vamos a limitar a mover enemigos, vamos a darles funcionalidades algo mas avanzadas , como&nbsp; que los enemigos detecten nuestra presencia y disparen . Tambien aprenderemos a disparar con trayectorias varias . El curso nos dar\u00e1 un buen nivel para realizar videojuegos de forma nativa con javascript y una gran soltura con la programaci\u00f3n orientada a objetos .&nbsp; Los alumnos que realicen este curso completo , tendran ofertas a mi pr\u00f3ximo curso de videojuegos al minimo precio posible.

Todo un resumen te\u00f3rico y pr\u00e1ctico para abordar el juego de la parte 3. </p><p>Tercer m\u00f3dulo: </p><p>Crearemos un juego completo , a\u00fanque anteriormente hemos visto ya te\u00f3ria , no por ello vamos a hacer rapidamente la programaci\u00f3n del juego. Explicar\u00e9 paso a paso cada linea de c\u00f3digo y el porqu\u00e9 . Para que el alumno no le resulte dificil la comprensi\u00f3n del mismo . </p><p><br></p><p>Objetivo final </p><p>El objetivo final es que el alumno sea capaz de entender y desmenuzar cada bloque del curso, para que el mismo pueda crear sus propios juegos . Esto es m\u00e1s importante que hacer el juego id\u00e9ntico al mio. Lo importante es aprender , hacer peque\u00f1os ejercicios , mover objetos, hacerles disparar, hacer un sistema de puntuaciones y dem\u00e1s.

Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2722434", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Programming Languages", "title": "Python Programming - From Basics to Advanced level [2021]", "level": "All Levels", "author": "EdYoda Digital University", "duration": "8 hours", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "5044", "students": "290249", "coupon_code": "FREENOV44", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2722434_fd59_6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-beginner-to-advanced/?couponCode=FREENOV44", "end_day": "2021-11-24 13:00:35+00:00", "headline": "This Python for beginners course will help you to become Zero to Hero.
