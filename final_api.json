The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2328856",

in 2022</strong> created by <strong><em>Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\".</em></strong></p><p>As digital marketing expands and evolves, the tools we use to advertise ourselves must also develop. Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you. What's more?&nbsp;This course will also contain the Google Ads dashboard walkthrough taught by Srinidhi and video advertising campaign creation steps along with the report-seeking process.</p><p>It's time to become a Professional YouTube Advertising Expert in the fastest time possible ever!</p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p><p>Enroll now and let's start the magic.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3614842", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "The Lean Startup: Best course on Entrepreneurship", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Navdeep Yadav", "duration": "357", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "535", "students": "82432", "coupon_code": "623004D378E86BE20FA1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3614842_51e4_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-lean-startup-best-course-on-entrepreneurship/?couponCode=LEANSTARTUP111", "end_day": "2022-05-19 02:31:00+00:00", "headline": "Turing you idea into a unicorn startup and raising investment from VC", "description": "<p>The <strong>Lean Startup Course</strong> will help you understand everything that you need to know about building a lean startup.

I know in additional to being afraid of the dark and height, speaking in front of others is a fear my child has exhibited. I like the way the Instructors talked directly to the child on the videos and used examples children could relate. I like the flow of the class. I learned there is a \u201cmagic phrase.\u201d I also learned to have my child to use the video that is on the PC, SmartPhone and Tablet as tool to help them with this skill. I could relate to several examples of what not to do. The Instructor teaches from the view of an experienced Media Personality. I would highly recommend this class.\"&nbsp;Ericka Bellamy Joseph</p><p>There is a 100% Money-Back Guarantee for this <strong>public speaking</strong>&nbsp;course.

As we focus on the differences, we always want to keep in mind the similarities in accounting for different business entities. Most of what we have learned about the double entry accounting system and day to day accounting transactions in prior courses will remain the same. We are concentrating on the areas that will different because the differences are where the new information lies. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will start by defining what a partnership is and comparing the characteristics of a partnership with other business entities. Understanding one business entity and its components are often best learned by contrasting them with the attributes of others, always considering the relative pros and cons, thinking of situations and circumstances that would benefit one form of business entity over another. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will discuss the process for setting up a new partnership, typically starting with the partners contributing capital to the partnership, requiring us to record the contribution and the capital accounts. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will discuss the allocation of net income to the partners, one of the primary differences between a partnership type of entity and other types of entities. There is a lot of flexibility for net income allocation in a partnership, and this is one of its primary benefits. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will cover the recording of partnership draws, how to record them, as well as the closing process for a partnership. The steps of the closing process will be much the same as those for any business entity except for the allocation of net income to the partners. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will consider the situation where a partner leaves a partnership or where a new partner is added. The transactions related to a partner leaving or being added is unique to a partnership entity. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will cover a partnership liquidation process or closing process. The liquidation process is a very useful exercise for any entity because it allows us to do take apart a business. We have discussed the process of putting new busses together in prior courses, but to fully understand how something works we must also take it apart. The liquidation process is particularly important for a partnership entity because it emphasizes the capital accounts and the process necessary to reduce the likelihood of problems during the process. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We also include a comprehensive problem designed to take a step back and consider all the similarities between business entities so that we can put the differences we have studied in this course into perspective.

Also, how to free yourself from self-imposed limitations and emotional disturbances and develop a communion or close communication with a Creator who lives within you, thus achieving emotional balance and instantly manifesting health, wealth, harmonious relationship, in short, your ideal life.</p><p>This course is based on true profound spirituality, access, and the manifestation of the Kingdom of Heaven (The Fourth Dimension), to which access goes inward to display your true being.</p><p>The lessons are based on my learned real-life experience after living almost ten years and dealing with the most negative, hostile, and difficult people in society. But I succeeded in understanding, active listening, and taking a different approach to emotional intelligence, which refers to perceiving, controlling, and evaluating emotions.</p><p>I compared this approach to the teachings to the Sages of the Kabbalah (The Book of Splendor), a secret text in Aramaic (ancient Hebrew) that has been enlightening only an \"elite\" or a small group of so-called prominent people, also used by the greatest thinkers who ever lived, also with Y\u2019shua\u2019s (Jesus) teachings and concluded that going to the center of our being, the innermost is the ultimate treatment to succeed in emotional control.</p><p>However, the real effective teachings have been strictly hidden from the masses because of society's controller fear of enlightenment and freedom of the entire world.</p><p>I will take you on an amazing journey of this powerful knowledge with a combination of challenging practices that will change your life forever.</p><p>I want to let you know that emotional intelligence or feelings control is the most important thing you must perform in your life. Having balanced and controlled emotions and feelings is crucial to a healthy lifestyle. But this must be work from inward to outward. Otherwise, it will temporarily relieve and return to the negative cycle.</p><p>One of the important focuses of this course is to access this amazing wisdom from the beginning level, getting all the knowledge to create the fundamental foundations for the best practices of emotional intelligence, manifestation, and mastery of the law of attraction.</p><p>The master key that opens all the doors to achieve the best version of yourself and experience lasting changes is the proposed Method 333.</p><p>The 333 Method comprises a powerful practice to reprogram your emotional intelligence, your mind consciously at the core and spiritual levels. This method combines knowledge of universal laws, the same as scientific theories, and provides you with a daily mental exercise routine.</p><p>The 333 Method is a practical tool that ensures lasting positive changes at the deepest level of your life.</p><p>There are three stages or levels in this method;</p><p><strong>3 Days of Deprogramming:</strong> release your mind from negative belief systems that are so rooted in your life that they operate on autopilot, hindering the manifestation of your ideal life. These three first days are crucial to preparing your mind, feelings, and moods for a new, amazing fresh beginning aligned with the best version of yourself.</p><p><strong>30 Days of Conscious Positive Mindset Programming:</strong> monitoring and substituting the old negative feelings and reactions patterns for positive, powerful ones based on your actual personality. Notice that the method focused on \"feelings and reactions\" because these are the human vibrations (electricity).</p><p>Vibrations are the unseen wires that connect (wireless connection) you with everything in the entire Universe. These 30 days will be the foundation of a new feeling, thinking, and assumption habits that will create a new belief system that positively impacts your life forever.</p><p><strong>300 Hours of Practical Manifestation:</strong> Once your feelings and new mindset are clean and ready, this course will guide you to practice the effortless manifestation of the fourth Dimension (4-D, Spiritual Dimension) using any unique desire you want to bring into existence.</p><p>This is when this unique and original style course comes to Mastering The law of attraction.</p><p>You can start now to experiment with spiritual healing, financial prosperity, harmonious relationships, happiness, or any of the wonderful unique gifts in the fourth Dimension, ready for you to bring it into existence.</p><p>Are you ready to take the challenge to experience lasting change in your life?</p><p>Make a small investment in yourself, act now, live the best version of Yourself.

I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.</p><p>One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it.

The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

AI is an analysis of how the machine is thinking, studying, determining, and functioning when it is trying to solve problems.</em></strong></p><p>These kinds of problems are present in all fields, the most emerging ones, and even beyond. The aim of Artificial Intelligence is to enhance machine functions relating to human knowledge, such as reasoning, learning, and problems along with the ability to manipulate things. For example, virtual assistants or chatbots offer expert advice. Smart robots or robot advisors will provide instant research or findings in the fields of finance, insurance, law, the media, and journalism, and medical diagnosis and support will be provided by AI software on the health front. Other advantages include increasing productivity dramatically in research and development programs by reducing time to the market, enhancing the transport and supply chain networks and improving governance by improved decision-making processes etc.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technology is aiding the following prominent fields for 2022 and many others:</p><p>Website Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to create websites and landing pages in merely minutes.</p><p>App Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to automate the whole concept of creating apps.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) \u2212 This process is simulating the actual interaction with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.</p><p>Expert Systems \u2212 Learners and users will be provided with guided information and advice on the computer or software.</p><p>Vision Systems \u2212&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;systems in 2022 can understand, explain and describe the computer's visual input to the ultimate core.</p><p>Spoken Word or Speech Recognition \u2212 Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based speech recognition systems are capable of listening, voicing and recognizing the user input - i.e. when a person speaks with them. Alexa, Siri and Google's assistant, are examples of this function. </p><p>Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help users to create and experiment with machine learning models and build data science applications in a flash. </p><p>Video Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate video production and cut high costs of hiring resources and teams as everything is taken care of in the cloud. </p><p>Python and Coding tools - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate writing lakhs of lines of code in python and even Java or PHP&nbsp;in minutes without the need for a human coder or even someone who will debug the code.

Stating additional forecasts, disruptive market trends are highly likely to occur in the AI Expansion period (i.e. 2025-2030), the opportunity for employment would require a high degree of personalization, innovation or ability tasks which will still require a person to perform them (even though the AI robotic tools have actually speeded up the process).

Sounds interesting?? Let\u2019s go ahead and learn what this is all about\u2026</strong><br></p><p>Let me ask you a few questions? Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey. Being a parent I know the toughest thing is to have your child express their feeling to you. We have covered this most important aspect of creative self-expression through different exercises and fun methods.</strong>&nbsp;</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1337550", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Productivity", "title": "Time Management Success", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Boomy Tokan", "duration": "67", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "175", "students": "19653", "coupon_code": "623004D378E86BE20FA1", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1337550_8fcb_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/time-management-success/?couponCode=BB639AF857B09D15338D", "end_day": "2022-05-21 09:08:00+00:00", "headline": "Be in control of your time and increase your productivity!", "description": "<p>Like many people I struggled with <strong>Time Management and Productivity</strong> for many years.

We can construct an&nbsp;accounting system where we record every financial transaction using debits and credits in a general journal, posting each journal entry to the general ledger, making the trial balance form the general ledger, and the financial statements from the trial balance. The process of recording every transaction using debits and credits is the process we have used in the past.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>To reduce the amount of data input when using a manual system, we can group transactions by transaction type and create special journals to record them. An accounting system using special journals can reduce data input by limiting the amount data needed to be input for each transaction due to the format of the special journal. Special journals can also eliminate the need to post each transaction to the general ledger. Rather than posting each transaction to the general&nbsp;ledger special journals are added up at the end of the period and one transaction is then posted for the entire period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Special journals are typically used in a manual system but understanding them helps any system because it helps to see what components of an accounting system are necessary to all accounting systems, which components can be changed, and when changing the format of the system would be beneficial. Automated systems also often general useful reports in a similar format as the special journals.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable and accounts payable are necessary&nbsp;for any system where we make&nbsp;sales on account and purchases on account.

So mein Eindruck nach dem Grundkurs. Ein paar \u00dcbungen zu den einzelnen Bl\u00f6cken w\u00fcrde ich mir w\u00fcnschen, aber vlt. habe ich die bis dato noch nicht entdeckt! Ferner, f\u00fchrt der Dozent mit Ruhe und einer sehr deutlichem Aussprache einem Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt durch die Themengebiete. Hier kommt einem also auch das Akustische sehr entgegen, denn nichts ist st\u00f6render, als einem \u201eRedner\u201c zuh\u00f6ren zu m\u00fcssen, der entweder nuschelt oder schlecht artikuliert.
