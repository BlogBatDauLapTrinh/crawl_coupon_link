Perhaps you don't feel really ready to leave your baby with strangers- or even with family. Perhaps you are worried about where you will find the energy to work full - or part - time... or how you will ever manage to get up in time for your commuter train if you have been up most of the night with your baby. Perhaps you are questioning how you will both survive on just a few hours together a day, when you are so used to uninterrupted days and nights together.</p><p><br></p><p>If you find any time to really consider your work, you may be contemplating how you'll manage to pick up your career where you left off - when you can hardly remember where you left the house keys.

Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,&nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.&nbsp; &nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It is the advent of vaccination for conditions such as Marek\u2019s disease, in addition to preproducing good quality day-old chicks starts with the breeder flock. Not only is the quality of the egg important, but also the health and nutritional status of the breeders are having an impact on day-old markable improvements in nutrition, genetics, and management, that has allowed the poultry industry to quickly develop since the late 1960s&nbsp; &nbsp; In general we can divide the factors associated with chick quality in two categories: EGG RELATED FACTORS hatchery and brooding management factors (egg handling , incubation, chick processing and placement SOURCES OF CHICKENS Primary breeding companies supply the breed performance These white hybrid layers are capable of laying 324 eggs per hen housed at 72 weeks of age with a feed conversion of 3.04 pounds of feed per dozen or 1.91 kg feed per kg of egg.der stock chickens for various breeder/hatchery companies who then supply the day-old pullet chicks to be grown into laying hens housing system feeding program in general&nbsp; &nbsp;lighting program&nbsp; economy of layer farm indices layer health management vaccination program suggested vaccination program spray vaccine onovo vaccine hatchary vaccine fowl pox vaccine cleaning disinfection receiving baby chicks&nbsp; automation in layer farm egg collection manure removal flock following rearing table postmortem&nbsp; procedures serology how to take blood sample how to make Elisa test&nbsp; Elisa software</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1738544", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Language Learning", "title": "Improve English by Listening Movies \u2013 1b", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yusuf Kat\u0131", "duration": "238", "rating": "2.7", "reviews": "221", "students": "35378", "coupon_code": "68A1C384", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1738544_e3f2_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/improve-english-by-listening-movies-1b/?couponCode=934E8683A6F75CC6E0B4", "end_day": "2022-06-02 13:20:00+00:00", "headline": "Listen movies and better understand spoken English in real life.", "description": "<p>Are you feeling so much difficulty to understand people in real life?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Can\u2019t understand exactly what that guy is telling you on the phone? &nbsp; </p><p>Not able to understand the speech when you are watching the video on the web? &nbsp; </p><p>You can easily understand a piece of text by reading, but you are not able to understand people by listening, have you been suffering from this problem since you started to learn English?

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course in Tamil will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Tamil"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3742636", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Other Business", "title": "Individual Income Tax Form 1040 Comprehensive Problem", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "466", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "34", "students": "15681", "coupon_code": "68A1C384", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3742636_ce97_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/individual-income-tax-form-1040-comprehensive-problem/?couponCode=33DBFA053D33513C359F", "end_day": "2022-06-04 23:50:00+00:00", "headline": "Construct a complex tax return step by step with a Certified Public Accountant CPA", "description": "<p>This is a project based income tax course. </p><p>We will construct a complex tax return in a step by step format, beginning with a basic return &amp; building complexity as we move forward. </p><p>The course will demonstrate the data input within 2020 income tax forms as well as the use of an Excel worksheet to check the numbers and demonstrate the use of tax software. </p><p>Using tax software &amp; an Excel worksheet, formatted as the income tax equation, are common, and best practices for many tax professionals, practices that greatly increase understanding and accuracy. </p><p>The practice problem with start by using basic tax data input forms such as W-2 forms and Form 1099s.

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \"stone\" in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles' successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.</p><p> LEARN Harmful Effects of Fungi: </p><p>1. Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp;

Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.</p><p>The Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as \u201cA fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\".</p><p>Six Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time. Six Sigma aspires to do the following - in general:</p><ul><li><p>Determine a problem.</p></li><li><p>Gather information about the problem's occurrence process.</p></li><li><p>Develop prospective problem-solving data-driven solutions.</p></li><li><p>To determine the best alternative, put the solutions to the test.</p></li><li><p>Create a system that will allow you to maintain a long-term solution.</p></li><li><p>Analyze the data and make any necessary adjustments. </p></li></ul><p>Let's get down to what this online course talks about. This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma's emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).</p><p>Please note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn't according to the client's specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer's perspective using Six Sigma methodology.</p><p><strong>Why opt for this course - the proven game-changer?</strong></p><p>By completing this<strong> \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\"</strong>, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!</p><p><em>This mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don't want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.&nbsp;What's more?

Frankly speaking, it was his marketing genius that set him and his company apart from everybody else on the planet. Now, I would like to re-incarnate Walt Disney into this course and put forth ideas from his perspective, imagining him to be your business coach, after all. What ideas Walt Disney would bring to your table if he lived now?</p><p>Yes, truly it started with a mouse and marketing - in the beginning.</p><p>Walt Disney may have created Mickey Mouse - but none of his success would have been possible without his marketing ingenuity. With the genius in him, he filled up movie theatres, theme parks and sold tons of Disney merchandise. Without Disney, there would be no Disney World and no family entertainment parks. He was the marketing genius for the 20th century!</p><p>While Disney went a bit overboard with his marketing, it's not like he didn't have some great ideas though. Walt Disney had amazing visions, but he was never very good at verbalising them. </p><p>Before that, think of all the big concepts created and promoted today through successful marketing. You should have the mantra that should be branded with your company. Let's take \"Think Different as an example of Apple Inc.\" First introduced in 1997 with this slogan, Apple has transformed into a multimillion-dollar business. The idea is simply to break away from conventional thinking and adapt to technology, customer needs and competition.</p><p>You have all these new ideas in your business, but how do you communicate them to the world? You need an ad campaign to get your idea out there too to reach the masses. Now, let's talk about how this course can be a differentiator when it comes to innovation and thinking like Walt&nbsp;Disney.</p><p><strong>Why enrol for this mind-blowing course \"Innovation 1.0\" that has the power to change the world of innovation forever?</strong></p><p>Your content marketing campaign is vital to the success of your organisation. You will know that the way you present your company's brand shapes people's views of your organisation. Times may have changed since Walt Disney's days but his marketing ideas are still an element of brilliance. Let's take a look at a few tactics from Walt Disney\u2019s angle to push your business idea to success.)</p><p>In the superb course, you will learn how Walt Disney would think about any idea about a product/service. We will be focussing on Disney\u2019s creative strategy which has the root cause of the success of the company and of course, Walt Disney, the man, the myth and the legend - himself.</p><p>I guarantee that this course is unlike any course you\u2019ve ever taken. It definitely helps in showcasing the most fantastic and absurd ideas possible from Disney\u2019s perspective and also focuses on how you can apply the same principles of Walt Disney to enjoy renewed and continuous business success.</p><p><strong>Welcome to My Class and Evoke the Brilliance of Disney</strong></p><p>Enrol now.

This is particularly important for samples that contain new or rare viruses for which diagnostic tests are not yet developed&nbsp; Many viruses can be grown in cell culture in the lab.</p><p>To do this, the virus sample is mixed with cells, a process called adsorption, after which the cells become infected and produce more copies of the virus&nbsp; &nbsp;Although different viruses often only grow in certain types of cells, there are cells that support the growth of a large variety of viruses and are a good starting point, for example, the African monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEp-2). One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome. Hence, it provides the most information about very small differences between two viruses that would look the same using other diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>Viral replication</strong> is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.&nbsp; Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.</p><p>Through the generation of abundant copies of its genome and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts. Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells. The host cell must provide the energy and synthetic machinery and the low- molecular-weight precursors for the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acids </p><p>virus&nbsp; life cycle </p><p>1.Attachment</p><p>2.Entry,</p><p>3.Uncoating,</p><p>4.Transcription / mRNA production,</p><p>5.Synthesis of virus components,</p><p>6.Virion assembly and</p><p>Viral replication of a bacteriophage[3]</p><p>7- Release (Liberation Stage).</p><p><strong>Attachment It</strong> is the first step of viral replication. The virus attaches to the cell membrane of the host cell. It then injects its DNA or RNA into the host to initiate infection..</p><p>In animal cells these viruses get into the cell through the process of endocytosis which works through fusing of the virus and fusing of the viral envelope with the cell membrane of the animal cell</p><p> <strong>Entry</strong>[</p><p>The cell membrane of the host cell invaginates the virus particle, enclosing it in a pinocytotic vacuole. This protects the cell from antibodies like in the case of the HIV virus.</p><p><strong>Uncoating&nbsp; Uncoating</strong></p><p>Cell enzymes</p><p>(from lysosomes) strip off the virus protein coat. This releases or renders accessible the virus nucleic acid or genome&nbsp; <strong>Transcription / mRNA production</strong>[]</p><p>For some RNA viruses, the infecting RNA produces messenger RNA (mRNA), which can translate the genome into protein products </p><p>For viruses with negative stranded RNA, or DNA, viruses are produced by transcription then translation.</p><p>The mRNA is used to instruct the host cell to make virus components. The virus takes advantage of the existing cell structures to replicate itself</p><p><strong>synthesis of virus components</strong>[</p><p>The components are manufactured by the virus using the host's existing organelles:</p><p>\u2022Viral proteins: Viral mRNA is translated on cellular ribosomes into two types of viral protein:</p><p>\u2022Structural: proteins which make up the virus particle</p><p>\u2022Nonstructural: proteins not found in the virus particle, mainly enzymes for virus genome replication </p><p>Viral nucleic acid (genome replication): New viral genomes are synthesized; templates are either the parental genome or newly formed complementary strands, in the case of single-stranded genomes. These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using integrase. Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases </p><p><strong>class 7: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate </strong>This small group of viruses, exemplified by the Hepatitis B virus, have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle&nbsp; (ccc DNA) that serves as a template for production of viral mRNAs and a sub genomic RNA. The progenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase and for production of the DNA genome.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2853144", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Other Office Productivity", "title": "Airtable Ultimate Course", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "276", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "61", "students": "28640", "coupon_code": "68A1C384", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2853144_864c.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-airtable/?couponCode=TRY100052203", "end_day": "2022-06-05 09:48:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Airtable", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to project management but don't know where to start?\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Would you like to make amazing projects and apps and bring your ideas to life?\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Then Airtable Ultimate Course is for you!\t</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Airtable is an in-demand skill in 2022.&nbsp; </p><p>The course begins with the basics.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.

The real issue of machine intelligence and literature is always compared with the potential of what human intelligence could do and machines cannot.&nbsp;This breathtaking course is all set to rewrite history proving that machine intelligence would finally equal the limits of human creativity and even go beyond the creative imagination that we have. The notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to 1872 with Samuel Butler and his novel titled \"Erewhon\". This stemmed from his earlier (1863) essay, \"Darwin among the Machines,\" in which he raised the concept of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that could replace human beings as the dominant species. Even within films such as 'Ex Machina' or 'Chappie', a single lone genius is the first to successfully create artificial general intelligence; real-world scientists find this impossible.

SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages.

The key focus area for these metrics are measuring \u201ctime to value\u201d or \u201ctime to market\u201d thereby generating direct business value. </p><p>With Kanban metrics, you don\u2019t need to guess when project work will be done, as they give you hard data on the productivity, efficiency, and reliability of your production process.</p><p><strong>About the course</strong></p><p>In this course, we'll be discussing the key Kanban Flow Metrics, the relationship between them and the charts you should be following to track the progress of your workflow.</p><p>Please find below the key Kanban metrics we are going to cover in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Work in progress</p></li><li><p>Cycle Time</p></li><li><p>Lead Time</p></li><li><p>Throughput</p></li><li><p>Work Item Age</p></li></ul><p>Along with the above metrics, we are also going to cover Cummulative Flow Diagram followed by in-depth coverage of Little's Law for a stable flow. We will also take you through some practical exercises for better understanding of these metrics &amp; their application.</p><p>This course is ideal for <strong>software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone who is looking to build productive teams and delivering maximum value early to their customers.</strong></p><p>Course enrollment grants you <strong>lifetime access to all the the entire course content including quizzes, practice exercises etc.</strong> In addition, you\u2019ll also r<strong>eceive 1-on-1 support for any questions or uncertainties that come up.</strong> And this all comes with a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee!</strong> You have nothing to lose and so much knowledge to gain.</p><p>I hope that you will enjoy the course, be challenged by it and learn a lot. </p><p>It is suggested that you go through the course at a pace that makes sense for you. The topics build on each other, so it is better to slow down and really learn something than to just move on in order to keep up a certain pace. </p><p>So, I have the tools needed to get the job done. So, let\u2019s do it, I\u2019ll see you in class.

The tiny details can help him understand if the actual work can be completed within the proposed time frame and budget. It also enables him to decipher the probable cost that may be incurred for completion. Thereby, it is necessary to list the probable costs or develop an estimate for the proposed work from its plans and specifications and this is crucial. </p><p>An estimate can be prepared by calculating the quantities from the drawings for various items and multiplying them with the unit cost of the concerned item or items. Calculating this can help to work out the approximate cost of the project in order to decide its' feasibility with respect to the cost and to also ensure the financial resources - supposedly the proposal is actually approved.</p><p>From quantities of different items of work that are calculated in detailed estimation, resources can be nearly allocated to different activities of the project and the project's duration and whole planning and scheduling of the project will be carried out. Let's look at the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in the field of estimation.</p><p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;methods have been extensively used in the fields of civil engineering applications e.g. construction management, building materials, hydraulic optimisation, geotechnical and transportation engineering, and newly added EHS.</em></strong></p><p>Artificial intelligence technology nowadays plays a key role to improve and support the construction sector, Artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;usage in Civil promises an opportunity to transform the efficiency and quality of developments in various ways. This includes even \"Building Plan&nbsp;Processes\" that can be figured out through automated means. In the field of Civil Engineering, automated technology is considered a boon. Artificial machines will survey a potential construction site during the planning stages to gather enough data to generate 3D models, blueprints, and designs for development. It took weeks to complete that task. Now simply because of Artificial Intelligence new-age tools, the process only takes one day. This helps companies save time and money. In the construction industry, the design of Artificial Intelligence encourages the concept of fully automated construction sites, for that matter.</p><p>AI can assist in the layout review technique (e.G. Layout optimisation), bidding manner or method (e.G. Predictive fashions of evolution of raw fabric expenses) and postmortem evaluation (e.G. Natural language processing to become aware of comparable work consignments) with the aid of analysing tremendous amounts of inner unstructured information (inclusive of bidding documents) and outside information (along with commodity prices) to provide insights from previous tasks. In doing so, C &amp; I groups can generate greater accurate estimates, reducing budgets and timeline deviations via an expected 10-20% and engineering hours with the boost or aid of 10-30%.</p><p>Also, while nearly investments in information analytics can generate great potential value, success or fulfilment is not only about truly acquiring and integrating new era technologies; it\u2019s approximately growing an organisational strategy and culture that combine an insights-pushed approach to key selections, strategies and commercial enterprise models in a manner that enables the company to invest on the proper time and for the right reasons - for that matter.</p><p>This super-series-based course&nbsp;<strong>\"Crash Course on Civil Engineering and AutoCAD: Part 2\"&nbsp;</strong> taught by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi Ranganathan\" and Civil&nbsp;Engineering Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\" will teach you incredible calculating or estimation methods for brickwork and&nbsp;plastering work through manual and automated means.&nbsp;The course also brings awareness of an Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) in&nbsp;Civil Engineering platform that allows anyone to design and manufacture their own product, plan or build, or plan.&nbsp;We will also talk about the purpose of \"estimation\" and its importance.</p><p><em>Everyone indulging in the civil engineering profession will clearly think of these reasons, i.e. the fixed amount of funds, costly labour (skilled and unqualified), difficulty in getting good building materials, particularly cement, and regular rising costs of concrete, bricks, timber, etc. Two important things are also needed in terms of economy and construction standards.

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it.

I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish. </em>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits. <em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a Winning Facebook Ad Campaign, so you can see what you need to do and why. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select The Right Ad To Achieve Your Marketing Goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, engaging ads. Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel For Ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set Up Your First Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover The Customer Journey To Purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find Your Ideal Customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to hone in on your perfect customer. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting The Most Out Of The Facebook Pixel And Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and fast.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events To Take Your Ad Game To The Next Level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Which all classification techniques are taught in this course?</strong></p><p>In this course we learn both parametric and non-parametric classification techniques. The primary focus will be on the following three techniques:</p><ol><li><p>Logistic Regression</p></li><li><p>Linear Discriminant Analysis</p></li><li><p>K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) </p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Classification techniques of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Classification is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn classification starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of classification.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3488950", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "No-Code Development", "title": "Super-Fast Web Design using Weebly (2022 Grand Edition)", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "93", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "108", "students": "43916", "coupon_code": "68A1C384", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3488950_6c0d_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/super-fast-web-design-using-weebly/?couponCode=MAY-033", "end_day": "2022-06-02 07:00:00+00:00", "headline": "A world-changing online course focussed on Weebly Web Design in 2022", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience </em><strong><em>\"</em>Super-Fast Web Design using Weebly (2022 Grand Edition)\"</strong>.</p><p>It's easier to build a stellar web design than you would ever imagine.

The impact of <strong><em>avatars</em></strong> on education is simply incredible. <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>-guided programs allow <strong><em>teachers like you</em></strong> to train in a <strong><em>virtual</em></strong> classroom.</p><p><strong>What's having an avatar all about?</strong></p><p>An avatar is a figure or character that can be created and customized using cloud-based tools. Avatars can be used for teacher training. Instructional coaches use a virtual classroom to train teachers by helping them master strategies such as questioning at a higher level or managing behaviour. Avatars imitate different types of students to help teachers practice classroom management and relate to their students. The trainee teachers stand in front of a projection screen on which they see avatars that are being controlled, or acted out, by actual students trained to behave a certain way. </p><p>Avatar-guided programs allow teachers to train before real students in a virtual classroom without the risk of making mistakes.&nbsp;Also, creating 3D&nbsp;trainer avatar characters across a school has initial start-up costs as well as fixed and variable costs that can be reduced as the software program is used over time. </p><p>This mind-blowing course teaches you some tools - even apps to create avatars in 2D&nbsp;or 3D for educational or instructional use in your classroom.&nbsp;We will also glance at a real-time 3D&nbsp;animation tool to speed up the animation process to create faster avatar animation - without any technical skills required from your end. </p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Impact on student learning studies conducted by the top universities in the world found that instructor applicants have changed the way they work in the classroom following four 10-minute sessions using avatar-powered platforms like VOKI. <em>Look at the first lecture to understand how to use the VOKI platform.</em></p><p>Students feel more engaged and enthusiastic by imitating the layout of campus and classrooms, even if they learn independently at home. This concept of immersive environments applies not only to universities but also to all kinds of online learning; it allows students to be part of a particular environment rather than feel like they are learning in isolation.</p><p>Avatars increase confidence in information sources, according to a Stanford study, and research shows that when characters guide interactions, people trust the information more than in identical, character-free interactions.</p><p>So, enrol now, there is a lot more to discover here in this course about Robot Teachers or what we call 'Avatars'.</p><p><strong><em>What are you waiting for? There is no time to waste.</em></strong></p><p>There are no technical skills required to learn this course.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \"supported for critical security issues only.\" Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beginner Friendliness</strong></p><p><strong>Easy to Get Started With</strong></p><p>PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don't understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.</p><p>The latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.</p><p><strong>Flexible</strong></p><p>PHP is a dynamically typed language. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, PHP is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Arabic"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2769396", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Microsoft", "title": "Microsoft Teams Ultimate Course 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "300", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "915", "students": "99302", "coupon_code": "68A1C384", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2769396_b847_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-microsoft-teams/?couponCode=TRY100052203", "end_day": "2022-06-05 09:48:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Microsoft Teams", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn Microsoft Teams but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to create Teams and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then Microsoft Teams 2022 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Microsoft Teams is an in-demand skill in 2022. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start creating Teams like an expert with Microsoft Teams.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of Microsoft Teams. </p><p>This is great for students starting or for IT Personal that need a refresher course on Microsoft Teams.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 5 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p>Here's What You'll Learn:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.

The site allows users to send \u201cSnaps\u201d, which are pictures or videos, to their followers. These Snaps disappear after a short period of time, giving users the (somewhat false) sense that anything they do won\u2019t last forever.</p><p>Snapchat can actually be extremely useful for your business, especially if you market to the younger crowd. In fact, 41% of U.S. residents between 18 and 34 use Snapchat every day!</p><p>But don\u2019t think that it won\u2019t benefit you if you market to older markets. Over half of new signups are for people who are over age 25. They may not use the site as regularly as the younger crowd, but they are there, and they are ready and willing to buy.</p><p>It is estimated that over 150,000,000 people use the app daily, and over 10 billion videos are watched each day. That\u2019s a massive user base that you shouldn\u2019t ignore.</p><p>Not only that, the site is actually an effective marketing tool, as well.

Java has an abundant API:</strong><br>Java has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing their inside implementations.</p><p>Java has mainly three types of API i.e. <strong>Official Java core API\u2019s, Optional official Java API\u2019s and Unofficial API\u2019s.</strong> These API\u2019s overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.</p><p><strong>5. Java has multiple Open Source Libraries:</strong><br>Open-source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open-source libraries in Java such as <strong><em>JHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons</em></strong>, etc. that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.</p><p><strong>6. Java has Powerful Development Tools:</strong><br>There are many Integrated development environments (IDE\u2019s) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. Powerful Java IDE\u2019s such as <strong>Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.</strong> play a big role in the success of Java.<br>These IDE\u2019s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.<br>Java has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around <strong>90% of fortune 500 companies</strong> to developing a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.</p><p><strong>7. Java is Free of Cost:</strong><br>One of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.</p><p><strong>8. Java is Platform Independent:</strong><br>Java is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.</p><p>Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.</p><p><strong>9. Java has great Documentation Support:</strong><br>The documentation support for Java is excellent using <strong>Javadoc</strong> which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.</p><p><strong>10. Java is Versatile:</strong><br>Java is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc. that make it quite versatile.</p><p>If you want to learn Java from scratch without any prior experience in programming then you should go for <strong>Java Foundation Course</strong>.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence.

We also know that humans are naturally visual beings, after all.</p><p>Video adds visual ambiguity and the absence of audio's emotional depth. That's one of the reasons why the digital web is increasingly becoming the backbone of video.</p><p>In hopes of expanding their following, creators convert their work into a video for YouTube, like young actors flocking to Hollywood for more exposure.</p><p>Podcasts have quickly gained prominence in just the last few years. Most of the main reasons for this was the transition to smartphones; customers switch away from desktops and more frequently use handheld devices. Also, search engines adjust their algorithms to offer mobile priority, making it more important than ever for organizations to concentrate on web or app optimization. As people rely more on mobile devices, viewing, uploading, and listening to podcasts has been simpler than ever, wherever and whenever. Another factor fueling podcasts' success is the lack of time for people. We appear to be busier than ever and the reality makes it impossible to calm down, read a book, or even watch a TV show without interruption. People like multitasking and doing as much as possible, and podcasts make it easy to listen on a drive, on a hike, while doing housework, and so on. </p><p>This compelling course focussed on<strong> \"Space Render 2.0: Transform your podcast into videos (2022)\"</strong>, takes a step further from the previous courses in&nbsp;Level 3 to completely open a new path for users to focus on podcast creation, marketing, and monetization using automation tools.
