has changed they accept that what you say to them makes something happen at a subconscious level so therefore when you say something to hypnotize them their is only one place to go into hypnosis.</p><p>Also accepting the words which are suggestions that take them into hypnosis which is a very nice place to go means that your words has taken them somewhere that makes them feel goo so if you give them a suggestion for changing an old behavior to something positive they may accept that change to become their new reality.</p><p>You will also learn how to discover your hypnotic voice by experiencing&nbsp; the difference between an ordinary speaking voice and a hypnotic voice along with my tips on how you could discover your own hypnotic voice.</p><p>You will also learn the importance of the right types of suggestions so that you take someone only in the direction they want to go because your wording needs more precision than everyday conversation as the inner critic that makes choices is offline during hypnosis, but I will demonstrate what I mean in this course. </p><p>One of the most important lessons you will learn in this course is how to get someones mind back on track if they should wander and get caught up in emotional stuff.</p><p>And of course the de-induction what to say to someone to bring them out of trance correctly and if you dont what you should do.</p><p><strong>What will you learn </strong></p><ol><li><p>Suggestibility Tests for getting into the right hypnotic mindset</p></li><li><p>Why Hypnosis Suggestions don,t Work</p></li><li><p>How to get your Hypnotic voice</p></li><li><p>Giving Suggestions in Hypnosis</p></li><li><p>Hypnosis Safety Instructions</p></li></ol><p><strong><em>Hypnosis Downloads to Improve your confidence as a Hypnotist </em></strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li><p><em>Becoming Successful Hypnosis. mp3 </em></p></li><li><p><em>Assertiveness Hypnosis for Confidence. mp3 </em></p></li><li><p><em>Deep Sleep Now. mp3 </em></p></li><li><p><em>Anxiety relief Hypnosis. mp3 </em></p></li><li><p><em>Having a positive attitude. mp3 </em></p></li><li><p><em>Motivation For Success Hypnosis. mp3 </em></p></li><li><p><em>Master Negotiator hypnosis. mp3 </em></p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2019-09-12_15-03-18-1ee95591d6d5166f04c481541675aab7/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637856929&Signature=D-ynxo5hKWwZaGGt1akVdgo8iomsO2RHb4Vdx55izw5ct4~kepqj7Ej2~bpc~EbXrvmIRri6cEf7Gb8NxWp1ItnpuczEq6lYPKXOMekMZ0-bmPTW-Uoqo2QSB06sSxlLlkGsW0uyoRXkZZ0zZ4GjYipJ~8Np99fnocbqOMtoFJQXLRw3N3L0P4n1hBFaNuV7TFdmsULruU6wFPMN~aL2LS2js5rDNCb55IahiMeUplPv7TP-vg~eLPrtkyquQZZWMkcohPOT4W58L9a7YL1EW4sI19FzgF2zqh8OllNJMlgpFLOhPIKxnaHZG1iYxAnTUvNzjl4FWMdkN3hz2vXG0Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4043852", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "PMP\u00ae Practice Test: Project Management Professional 2021", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Debajyoti Adhya", "duration": "", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "33", "students": "17761", "coupon_code": "DA49D2F2A188A7425632", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4043852_84bd.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-practice-test-project-management-professional-2021/?couponCode=DA49D2F2A188A7425632", "end_day": "2021-11-28 16:28:18+00:00", "headline": "Prepare yourself to pass the PMP\u00ae certification exam in 2021 The Complete PMP\u00ae Practice Test - 360 Questions", "description": "<p>The <strong>PMP\u00ae</strong> certification is the most widely and globally recognized project management certification in 2021.

That means knowing the majority of PRINCE2\u00ae Practitioner content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required.

Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.
