You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639477726&Signature=DXqXvlXSxXeFKHd8337LtDBvut7SA7toULcB0kmBTI9VQOSwX-8ObbWvxjlAiN0E-dpsqirY~f8QRWkyepIa0Inq1PmCIyHK-cvOb3R9znRjIWVGTVF-4C1JFg-dxL08mM9lCYIcKyoL5XzDUBUVVwIrNz26NMG6BGZG3oE81pUDdUBqLpFSse4JkEHlvMJzvRRQaa2SEgMjafAQJ7eaOMfLHbEKo3YfzCIsxBO2eZQHgPUldwm~9wqxDVRypHgR4UMXd8fOFxNHUXuuUyB6JY6qw1JsR7pgKi0Getjb8ZSxaNoDvh2oD0DoPCzLUYaLLGSIFsXL4vsPFp78MwwFGg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3833784", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Digital Marketing Strategy Bundle: 5 practical courses in 1!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Anton Voroniuk", "duration": "7.5 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "1960", "students": "124099", "coupon_code": "DIGITALMARKETING1412", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3833784_12ca_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-marketing-strategy-from-scratch-course/?couponCode=DIGITALMARKETING1412", "end_day": "2021-12-18 06:59:25+00:00", "headline": "Grow your business with Digital Marketing Strategy, Content Marketing, SEO, Social Media Marketing, and Google Analytics", "description": "<p>Do you want to grow your business online?

This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames, passwords,\u00a0credit cards and other sensitive\u00a0information.\u00a0<br><br>In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</p><p>Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The term <em>Six Sigma</em> originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a <em>sigma</em> rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.</p><p>Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p><p>In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\".</p><p>In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "1085718", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "Learn 70 Great Websites to Get Unlimited  Royalty FreeImages", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Alagappan K", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "2.9", "reviews": "15", "students": "11801", "coupon_code": "327B135B62C55843A878", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1085718_83dd_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/70-websites-to-get-unlimited-high-quality-royalty-freeimages/?couponCode=327B135B62C55843A878", "end_day": "2021-12-19 05:02:15+00:00", "headline": "A Complete Guide to Learn How to Find High Quality Royalty Free Stock Images  Through 70 Great  websites", "description": "<p>In this course we'll\u00a0 learn how to find royalty free stock images for personal &amp; commercial projects.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As we all know stock photos are costly but still we need to used it into our projects, so this is why we'll come up with this course where we'll tech you my best 70 free sources that you can used to find high quality royalty free images for your personal or even commercial projects.
