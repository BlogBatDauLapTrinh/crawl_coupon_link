If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

The advantages of using RMA sample tests include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increasing Your Speed</strong> \u2013 The RMA exam has a three hour time limit.

Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called <em>digital representation</em> or, more specifically, a <em>digital image</em>, for the object, and <em>digital form</em>, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitate processing by digital computers and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.</p><p>Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\". Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organizations around the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Haytham H.

This could be the first step to a new high-paying job and an AMAZING career. If you\u2019ve been around the block a few times, consider taking a moment and answering some questions from newer techies.</p><p><strong>What Should You Know Before Studying The PRINCE2\u00ae Practitioner ?</strong></p><p>Every exam and certification has different requirements.

That means knowing the majority of PRINCE2\u00ae Practitioner content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the PRINCE2\u00ae Practitioner but it may take some extra work.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2604580", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Ultimate Beginner Guide to Streamlabs OBS (OBS)", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "245", "students": "68571", "coupon_code": "52ED37B5016C4584BA42", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2604580_c9b0_5.jpg?secure=KOHlV4Kao6pbWiZw7Hg1Ig%3D%3D%2C1637935659", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-beginner-guide-for-streamlabs-obs/?couponCode=52ED37B5016C4584BA42", "end_day": "2021-11-30 03:44:13+00:00", "headline": "Learn everything you need about livestreaming on Twitch, YouTube, Mixer and more with SLOBS fast and easy", "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Ultimate Beginner Guide to Streamlabs OBS (OBS)!</strong></p><p>Nick Nyxson here, Your Instructor for this course.</p><p>In this course, you will learn how to start using&nbsp; Streamlabs OBS which is live streaming software made by Streamlabs and is a modified version of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).</p><p>In this course You Will Learn:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What is SLOBS (Streamlabs OBS);</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How Streamlabs OBS is any different from OBS Studio;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlabs OBS Settings Walkthrough;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlabs OBS Sources and Scenes;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Steamlabs OBS Tabs;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>and Much, Much More!</strong></p></li></ul><p>Everything you will learn here will be based on My practice as a video content creator and Streamer and Everything shown step by step as I am performing everything live on video.</p><p>Most importantly this course will continue and grow as time passes and all the upgrades will be available for FREE for every enrolled student.</p><p>And don't forget that Instructor is here for you.
