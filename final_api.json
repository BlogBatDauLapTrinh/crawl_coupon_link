The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.</p><p>We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.</p><p>The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-06-24_03-07-22-b9a0707f018e7f72b318010bfa0b42a5/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639069191&Signature=OP2tfHEK7fd3amW1Xc0Ux6Jl5FmtLNj0z5GnloQQ34OtNieCRUC6YPc~EC5ZwIOYB8SUI3mPx7pMkMzSPgogZoN3SW8-eRUQ7efVQIEu56Li14dvFkDZVeRPDhTM90bZzccXEYeaxzHaiaGtOjKmK-0qZbp4XGgc1S2wMj5a~lDPxZImZWX9HNwl1VUGEdrVFzvIVV6Y9h95bbv9khIw62etUHyWcvUYKp3j9wVfJE6johXh4uS9p1tmJgPiHP5hQgtqyj8uj465WnkVmYbXwpWzBvnK2~npfK6pPwCoTatxf-PVeqkTn4mD8DovQI6G8lmSljTI7ZGA1DnaI6eT-Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3423978", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Atlassian Confluence Masterclass for Project Managers", "level": "All Levels", "author": "GenMan Solutions", "duration": "5.5 hours", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "412", "students": "80223", "coupon_code": "CONDEC1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3423978_990e.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/atlassian-confluence-masterclass/?couponCode=CONDEC1", "end_day": "2021-12-11 07:35:41+00:00", "headline": "Confluence: Complete & Comprehensive course on the Cloud version of Atlassian's Confluence for Project Management", "description": "<p>Confluence is a <strong>powerful enterprise collaboration tool</strong> that brings people, knowledge, and ideas together in a shared workspace, so you can do your best work.
