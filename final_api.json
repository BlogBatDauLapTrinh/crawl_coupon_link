However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2254351", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Database Design & Development", "title": "Microsoft SQL Server Development for Everyone", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Trevoir Williams", "duration": "6 hours", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "1042", "students": "116620", "coupon_code": "MSSQL_FREE_JAN", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2254351_136c_6.jpg?secure=GBtQWzFCyoznI4TCw-xYwg%3D%3D%2C1641708225", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-sql-server-2017-for-everyone/?couponCode=MSSQL_FREE_JAN", "end_day": "2022-01-12 20:14:50+00:00", "headline": "Learn the fundamentals of database design, development and querying using the latest Microsoft SQL Server", "description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>This is a zero to hero course on <strong>Microsoft SQL Databases</strong> and <strong>Querying</strong>.

In this complete video guide, you\u2019ll learn everything you need to know to get started building great links - the type that actually help to boost your SEO.</p><p>We\u2019ll teach you the techniques you need to know to avoid getting penalised by Google, and what Google looks for when it ranks your link. You\u2019ll learn why Site Relevance, Page Authority, and Domain Authority are important when it comes to the sites your links appear on and you\u2019ll understand what makes up a link and how search engines interpret this.</p><p><strong>One of the most important things we\u2019ll teach you is the right strategies to get more links - right now.</strong> You can\u2019t just do the same old things you might have done a few years ago, link building has changed, and, in this guide, you\u2019ll find the latest strategies to help you succeed with link building.</p><p>We\u2019ve covered ALL the essentials, from the right way to approach guest blogging to how to perform successful link-building outreach, so you can get those all-important links on high authority relevant sites.</p><p>After watching this course, as long as you\u2019re prepared to put in just a little effort, you\u2019ll soon be able to acquire useful links that will give your search ranking a huge boost.</p><p><strong>We are confident you can succeed with link building, if you want to</strong> - and this guide will ensure you\u2019ll have all the tools you need to form a link-building strategy that will help you achieve great results.</p><p><strong>What is Link Building?</strong></p><p><strong>The No 1 goal of link building is to boost your search engine visibility by getting links to your website on as many high-quality sites as possible.</strong> </p><p>There are numerous strategies you can use to achieve this, from the simple to the complex, including Content Marketing, Blogger Outreach, Resource Page linking, and PR.</p><p>Google used to use Page Rank to determine a page\u2019s quality, which was partly based on how many people were linking to it. But when people found out how to game Page Rank, Google lost the ability to detect what was a good link and a bad one, which reduced their ranking algorithms effectiveness.</p><p>In 2012 Google made some crucial updates, to weed out shady black hat link building techniques and better determine quality links. They now place a lot of importance on link quality, as well as quantity, meaning where your link appears is just as crucial, if not more, as how many links you get.</p><p>Now Google regularly penalizes websites who use black hat techniques or over-optimise with low-quality link building. The value of certain techniques such as submitting your site to web directories has also fallen, due to being repeatedly overused.</p><p>Search engines use backlinks to find out about new web pages, which they then include in search results. They also use them to evaluate a page\u2019s ranking position within search results.</p><p>Even though there have been a lot of changes, links are still critical if you want to rank well on Google. But employing low-quality link building techniques is not only a waste of your time and effort - but it could also actively damage your website\u2019s ranking.</p><p>The bottom line is backlinks are still so vital to your visibility in search, they are Google\u2019s key ranking signal. It\u2019s <em>pivotal</em> to learn the most current white hat techniques that will help you acquire great backlinks, so keep watching as we show you what to avoid, and what to do in order to build high quality backlinks this year.</p><p><strong>What can Link Building do for you?</strong></p><p>Link building is important if you\u2019re looking to build relationships with people in your industry for two primary reasons.</p><ol><li><p>It can help you acquire valuable backlinks on highly relevant, popular sites, but it also aids you in making connections over the long term. When you contact an influencer, site owner, or blogger with a well-written pitch that demonstrates the value of linking to you, you make that all-important first contact with someone who can be incredibly influential in your niche.</p></li><li><p>Even if they don\u2019t say yes, the first time around, providing your pitch is polite and relevant, you\u2019ll have made that all-important first contact. Next time, they might well say yes, or they might even come to you.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Get the RIGHT kind of traffic</strong></p><p>Links are incredibly useful for boosting your referral traffic and if you get a backlink on a popular website in your niche, you\u2019ll likely see a significant increase in visitors. As the traffic will already be pre-screened for interest, if your link appears on a relevant site, rather than a more general one - it\u2019s more likely to convert.</p><p>Getting your content, products, or services in front of people who are interested is a superb way to up the value of your links. Even if they don\u2019t buy from you right away, you\u2019ve raised your profile to an ideal target audience. This is something you should always be looking to do if your goal is to boost your SEO and expand your business.</p><p><strong>Establish your brand authority</strong></p><p>Your link building strategy can also help solidify your brand authority, particularly if you create content that\u2019s relevant to what you offer, and valuable to potential customers.</p><p>If you have a sportswear e-commerce store for example and published a piece entitled <em>\u201cGo from couch potato to 10K runner in 6 months\u201d</em>, this would be extremely relevant to a significant portion of your audience.</p><p>There\u2019s three ways you can benefit here.</p><ol><li><p>First, you\u2019re attracting people to your brand, who\u2019ve searched for the terms your piece has ranked for. Now they know who you are and are more likely to consider you an authority on a subject they are interested in.</p></li><li><p>Secondly, you\u2019ll raise your site authority with Google if enough people link to your piece, which also helps to boost your search engine ranking.</p></li><li><p>Thirdly, you may make some sales, if you link smartly to your products in the piece, or at the end, or if you include offers placed well around your article.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What\u2019s a hyperlink made of?</strong></p><p>To comprehend properly how links work and how search engines read them, you first need to understand all the different parts of a hyperlink - and what function they play.</p><p><strong>There are four main parts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Anchor tag</p></li><li><p>Href</p></li><li><p>Anchor text</p></li><li><p>Tag closure</p></li></ul><p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at what these different parts do\u2026</p><p><strong>Anchor tag </strong>- This is the part of your link that opens your link tag and lets search engines know a link is included.</p><p><strong>Href</strong> - Href is short for hyperlink referral and is the text inside the quote marks that shows where your URL is pointed to. It basically tells your browser where it needs to head to, whether that\u2019s a web page, image, or a file.</p><p><strong>Anchor text</strong> - This is the visible text that people click on when they open your link. It\u2019s often formatted differently from the rest of the text surrounding it, typically with an underline or blue colour to show it has been clickable.</p><p><strong>Tag closure</strong> - This one\u2019s pretty straightforward, it\u2019s the part of your link that lets the search engines know it\u2019s now the end of your tag.</p><p><strong>How to get Links Google LOVES</strong></p><p>Your focus should be on acquiring links that will have a positive impact on your Google rank, and often the best kinds of links are the ones you never even asked for.</p><p>You get these types of links by consistently creating something of quality, whether that\u2019s informative content, a unique website, or a really great product or service. When you do this regularly, people notice - and they naturally want to link to you.</p><p>Though you should <em>always </em>be trying to achieve these kinds of organic links, you shouldn\u2019t sit around waiting for people to link to your site. Instead, actively help to raise more awareness of your brand and content by using a link building strategy that boosts your Google rankings.</p><p>While not all Google ranking factors are known, there are many which most experts agree have a definite impact on your search position. Start watching as we\u2019re about to reveal the most important Google ranking factors you need to be aware of when it comes to link building.</p><p><strong>We really hope you will love learning all about backlinks and how to build them!</strong></p><p>Ing.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2776932", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Investing & Trading", "title": "Investor Business Pitch, Pitch Deck Outline & Sales Pitch", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Alex Genadinik", "duration": "1.5 hours", "rating": "3.1", "reviews": "28", "students": "4619", "coupon_code": "9A583371F0342703438B", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2776932_7b23_13.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/investor-pitch-deck/?couponCode=9A583371F0342703438B", "end_day": "2022-01-12 13:48:59+00:00", "headline": "Learn to pitch your business to potential investors like venture capitalists, or angel investors, co-founders, partners", "description": "<p>Learn to do an elevator pitch in 1-sentence instead of the typical 60-seconds, and expand that into a full investor pitch deck presentation.</p><p>In your career as an entrepreneur, you will pitch your business many times per day, every day.</p><p>\"If you can't explain something to a 5-year-old, you don't understand it yourself.\" - Einstein</p><p><strong>CLEAR AND&nbsp;EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION&nbsp;IS&nbsp;A&nbsp;SIGN&nbsp;OF&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;PROFESSIONALISM</strong></p><p>Junior professionals typically pay less attention to the clarity and effectiveness of communication.

It\u2019s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. Beside that all topics are presented on real-life examples - this help grasp knowledge faster.</p><p>One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is implementation of backend system for online store. Also you have a lot of tasks that use domain specific terminology:&nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain specific terminology and during the lessons we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you clear vision how you can apply the knowledge in real life.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4322510", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Other Office Productivity", "title": "Planning Center Made Easy", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Brandon K Maddux", "duration": "6 hours", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "341", "coupon_code": "COURSECREATOR", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4322510_a9df_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/planningcenter/?couponCode=COURSECREATOR", "end_day": "2022-01-12 03:38:23+00:00", "headline": "Learn Planning Center in 10 Days or Less.", "description": "<p>Our church wanted to use Planning Center, but we had no clue where to get started.

API's chief functions on behalf of the industry include advocacy, negotiation and lobbying with governmental, legal, and regulatory agencies; research into economic, toxicological, and environmental effects; establishment and certification of industry standards; and education outreach. API both funds and conducts research related to many aspects of the petroleum industry.</p><p><br></p><p>Although some oil was produced commercially before 1859 as a byproduct from salt brine wells, the American oil industry started on a major scale with the discovery of oil at the Drake Well in western Pennsylvania in 1859.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute was founded on 20 March 1919 and based in New York City.</p><p>In 1959, at a symposium organized by the American Petroleum Institute and the Columbia Graduate School of Business for the centennial of the American oil industry, the physicist Edward Teller warned then of the danger of global climate change. Edward Teller explained that carbon dioxide \"in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect\" and that burning more fossil fuels could \"melt the icecap and submerge New York\".</p><p>In 1969, the API decided to move its offices to Washington, DC.</p><p><br></p><p>API Standards Committees are made up of subcommittees and task groups that works and maintain these standards.
