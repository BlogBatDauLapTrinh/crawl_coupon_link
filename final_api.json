We plan on updating this course so that you can continue to use it as a reference even as QuickBooks Online evolves its software. We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online. We will go over each option in more detail in the course.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial, perfect to practice with</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They also often offer a student version, which may provide more extended access to the software, and this would be great considering we will be covering a comprehensive problem.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>QuickBooks also provides a free test drive file.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the course will discuss how to access QuickBooks Online, the accounting software options QuickBooks offers, and set up our QuickBooks file.</p><p>We will then practice navigating the accounting software, the free QuickBooks Online Test Drive File being our primary tool. When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-09-15_01-25-06-3a8c355b7d04a65d32a35037dbca4675/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1641752972&Signature=WXkLCAHd9D~TMRm~8jtPi7iv3Fuemzz1OvZ-OEmNo~cnp-1D~edkw~mUz5yyO18sYqONwr7Lb9hEBu9030qFPz3Lk3WXUSIEH4K88kI31x4RejOkwm9x4~vkw-EFAuxjM7rwTmIQt~sZ17i~aKab39WpzDf8Z8AfsgfvUJ0AOeAiszlgq6jy18WSi7E~stmvZa9JujAziUOc3MP0gGwiJFR8C8uZXAu-TO~24q1vTXPv9wGmaj4uOHNFhLx3gpSoymTUoIiLRYyDyligmnWFicT4Lbbh0DkebxDUFLE8rpi1JQMN-riRhFWMxNjmCsrxj2ELe6zw0Ry7x~aDC2PmKg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4473474", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Drupal Guide 2022", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Wilhelm Laubach", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "655", "coupon_code": "FIVSHUBHAM", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4473474_50bb.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/drupal-training/?couponCode=FIVSHUBHAM", "end_day": "2022-01-14 09:09:30+00:00", "headline": "A comprehensive guide on what Drupal is and how to properly use it", "description": "<p>The following videos aim to offer a comprehensive guide on what Drupal is and how to properly use it.

It is only possible through efficient resources management, leadership, and identifying customer needs and requirements.</em></p><p><em>Any organization-type of any size and in any industry can implement ISO 9001. An organization can use it as a generic management system and tailor it to their needs.</em></p><p><em>ISO 9001 requires organizations to determine the needs and expectations of their interested parties. They then develop a system that enables them to fulfill the requirements. These requirements must be regularly evaluated and updated based on changing circumstances and trends.</em></p><p><em>ISO 9001 is a risk-based system. A core purpose of the entire management system is to prevent adverse events from occurring. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to understand the risks associated with each activity, interested party, and internal or external factors. Furthermore, such assessments lead to the discovery of new opportunities. While analyzing different systems and communicating with interested parties, you will become aware of new opportunities.

However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4268574", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "American Petroleum Institute API PRACTICE QUESTIONS", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "4", "students": "3764", "coupon_code": "6471A429BECF462976F6", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4268574_a0d3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/american-petroleum-institute-api-practice-questions/?couponCode=6471A429BECF462976F6", "end_day": "2022-01-12 16:06:33+00:00", "headline": "American Petroleum Institute API PRACTICE QUESTIONS API 570  API 571", "description": "<p>The <strong>American Petroleum Institute</strong> (<strong>API</strong>) is the largest U.S. trade association for the oil and natural gas industry.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4472018",

I'm going to add it to this main course as well as a \"compilation course\".</p><p>ISO 9001 is the focus of this course. There\u2019s nothing more important in today\u2019s market than the ability to effectively deliver value to your customers. It is only possible through efficient resources management, leadership, and identifying customer needs and requirements.</p><p>Any organization-type of any size and in any industry can implement ISO 9001. An organization can use it as a generic management system and tailor it to their needs.</p><p>ISO 9001 requires organizations to determine the needs and expectations of their interested parties. They then develop a system that enables them to fulfill the requirements. These requirements must be regularly evaluated and updated based on changing circumstances and trends.</p><p>ISO 9001 is a risk-based system. A core purpose of the entire management system is to prevent adverse events from occurring. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to understand the risks associated with each activity, interested party, and internal or external factors. Furthermore, such assessments lead to the discovery of new opportunities. While analyzing different systems and communicating with interested parties, you will become aware of new opportunities. These can be opportunities for innovation, improved terms, and conditions, investments in new infrastructure, or new training opportunities.</p><p>A foundational concept of quality management is continual improvement. It means that leadership or top management must reassess the management system at regular intervals. There have to be procedures in place for them to evaluate and assess the effect of their actions. These reports can help them make better decisions in the future and restart the cycle of plan-do-check-act.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-12-18_23-23-51-96376a398fd49c6d94fff9580090a8cd/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=gyowL5zqpN7UUqIqXl4g7A%3D%3D%2C1641753063"}, {"course_id": "4467210", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "AWS Certified Security Speciality", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ibrahim Serrafi", "duration": "", "rating": "2.5", "reviews": "1", "students": "2021", "coupon_code": "FCA47699F24B826E6939", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4467210_40c0_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-security-speciality-a/?couponCode=FCA47699F24B826E6939", "end_day": "2022-01-14 13:19:43+00:00", "headline": "Get your AWS Certified Security Speciality Certification from the first attempt", "description": "<p>Are you ready to take the 2022 - just out of beta - AWS Certified Security Speciality exam?<br></p><p><br></p><p>This practice test course contains 5 complete timed tests, of at least 65-questions each, just like you will get in the official exam.

A core purpose of the entire management system is to prevent adverse events from occurring. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to understand the risks associated with each activity, interested party, and internal or external factors.

These can be opportunities for innovation, improved terms, and conditions, investments in new infrastructure, or new training opportunities.</em></p><p><em>A foundational concept of quality management is continual improvement.

I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover the customer journey to purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find your IDEAL customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to HONE IN ON YOUR PERFECT CUSTOMER. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be sharing POWERFUL INSIDER TARGETING STRATEGIES that will SUPERPOWER your custom and lookalike audience set up.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting the most out of the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and FAST.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events to take your Ad game to the next level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to GET MORE from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Facebook Ads Reporting and Attributions</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll show you how to use Facebook Reporting to create interactive weekly email reports on all your Facebook Ad campaigns. This will help you see how all your Facebook Ads are performing and where your Ad spend is going.</p><p>This is invaluable information as you'll be able to funnel your ad spend to where it returns you the best investment. It also helps you identify weak areas, so you can see where you might be going wrong, and where you can improve.</p><p>You\u2019ll also learn how to harness the power of Facebook Attributions, so you can use data driven tracking models to understand browser\u2019s interaction with your ads, across multiple platforms.</p><p>Facebook attributions let you gain a greater insight into the customer journey to purchase. This is an awesome tool for any advertiser, as it enables you to measure the incremental impact of each of your ads in your customer\u2019s path to conversion.</p><p><em>WAIT THAT'S NOT ALL\u2026</em></p><p>You'll also be getting some amazing bonuses that will really help you to TAKE YOUR MARKETING GAME TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</p><p><strong>Convert more, sell FASTER</strong></p><p>You'll receive my EXCLUSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR MAXIMISING YOUR AD CONVERSION RATE ON FACEBOOK.</p><p>Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages.

The process approach is mentioned in the introduction of ISO 9001 and throughout the standard. We're going to focus on that specific aspect of the standard. I'm going to be discussing processes in detail. A process comprises inputs, activities, and outputs. </p><p>There\u2019s nothing more important in today\u2019s market than the ability to effectively deliver value to your customers. It is only possible through efficient resources management, leadership, and identifying customer needs and requirements. Being able to do this at a process level is essential. </p><p>Any organization-type of any size and in any industry can implement ISO 9001. An organization can use it as a generic management system and tailor it to their needs. All organizations can break down their activities into processes with inputs, activities, and outputs. Analyzing these processes and taking actions to plan, maintain, and improve them leads to increased customer satisfaction.</p><p>ISO 9001 requires organizations to determine the needs and expectations of their interested parties. They then develop a system that enables them to fulfill the requirements. The systems are made up of processes and must be regularly evaluated and updated based on changing circumstances and trends.</p><p>ISO 9001 is a risk-based system. A core purpose of the entire management system is to prevent adverse events from occurring. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to understand the risks associated with each process. Furthermore, such assessments lead to the discovery of new opportunities. While analyzing different processes and communicating with interested parties, you will become aware of new opportunities. These can be opportunities for innovation, improved terms, and conditions, investments in new infrastructure, or new training opportunities.</p><p>A foundational concept of quality management is continual improvement. It means that leadership or top management must reassess the management system processes at regular intervals. There have to be procedures in place for management to evaluate and assess the impacts of their actions. These reports can help them make better decisions in the future and restart the cycle of plan-do-check-act. In this course, you'll learn how to apply plan-do-check-act to processes. </p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-12-28_23-58-36-bba2281d20f93b1846ad6063448b75ef/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1641753226&Signature=h52l~7MJP3qIT7LI7EKsfOirybKRbNc~MhCDJnDfprTi7LEL4Hv4wz98-wFQc8UG3Y5sgR~Oimbue9jb~T9RHcIvkvZaJGBO1J46xqJnW5cBla40uHfMrkDLsixWc0gR~09C8avvAESfdtA1GIdsROU9Gx0ir1ZhAz9eQvQL2A2qofZXd0-DqwRDSBV47B2989KBn0Oot-3Q-K1QCj9mOZ~CuFmak9tK0JgVV1vfIZFtxc865JgAGr67cUMONDaHCtY17HtT2H8PE7dn2r0FF26hB5xsGk907xGObE9fNeDrAuDAdpQn5N8YsvZs7Gl98hQ9MDPDYvHVI5JT~Zsgqg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "754112", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_category": "General Health", "title": "Healthy living with \"No Oil\" Recipes - Non Vegetarian", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Susmita Dutta", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "79", "students": "21646", "coupon_code": "JAN2022FREE1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/754112_7441_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/no-oil-cooking-meat-recipes-no-cholesterol-fat-free-food/?couponCode=JAN2022FREE1", "end_day": "2022-01-12 22:24:32+00:00", "headline": "Better Health.

It was designed to be quick, practical and goal-oriented and to provide people with long-term skills to keep them healthy. The focus of cbt is on the problems that come up in a person\u2019s day-to-day life. cbt helps people to look at how they interpret and evaluate what is happening around them and the effects these perceptions have on their emotional experience.</p><p>Childhood experiences and events, while not the focus of cbt, may also be reviewed. This review can help people to understand and address emotional upset that emerged early in life, and to learn how these experiences may influence current responses to events</p><p>According to cbt, the way people feel is linked to the way they think about a situation and not simply to the nature of the situation itself</p><p>In cbt, you learn to identify, question and change the thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and assumptions related to your problematic emotional and behavioural reactions to certain kinds of situations.</p><p>By monitoring and recording your thoughts during situations that lead to emotional upset, you learn that the way you think can contribute to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. In cbt, you learn to reduce these emotional problems by: \u2022 identifying distortions in your thinking \u2022 seeing thoughts as ideas about what is going on rather than as facts \u2022 \u201cstanding back\u201d from your thinking to consider situations from different viewpoints</p><p>For cbt to be effective, you must be open and willing to discuss your thoughts, beliefs and behaviours and to participate in exercises during sessions. For best results, you must also be willing to do homework between sessions.</p><p>CBT is an effective treatment for many psychological conditions. These include: \u2022 mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder \u2022 anxiety disorders, including specific phobias (fear of animals, heights, enclosed spaces), panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder \u2022 bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder \u2022 body dysmorphic disorder (body image) \u2022 substance use disorders ( smoking, alcohol and other drugs).</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-12-31_08-26-44-b55186720cc70cf25965df1e6e1eeb4a/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1641753248&Signature=Ys-gxKUMIyU9RS9DGa6s-3-xq3in0vt9~htGZbdUlcNVRC-jPFz4-u17DtX7oGGqjtumki8ca1KEgw2t40rZqCm9qEI0~oYdYiaEzaCEiwHTmZYY2sKgQjqeUQx9rt74x1mj5Z7k97z8o0FLiBHoxSARwJb2mf5GQgAr50PlALZNWpN9fV94uib-JEKxfuf7ZN6FSaq8qg~KL7aVb~IZOPbS~jQej2u~2oRfePPuHfigMYwB5i8bDvmg0Z59HxsXf6RalDUrDXhX82W5SnPeskfixZmRY31DVZMo4On92E0~fU-clHwiGNzh1V0NczaaIqk4ILlXPlBzccU4Xt-3bg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2816121", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Bank Feeds-QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage, Wave (Comparison)", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "25 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "50", "students": "20514", "coupon_code": "2480395141F3FAF54409", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2816121_6124.jpg?secure=0CFH2rHHSO0CJ2H9Otneeg%3D%3D%2C1641823456", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/bank-feeds-quickbooks-online-xero-sage-wave-comparison/?couponCode=2480395141F3FAF54409", "end_day": "2022-01-14 05:41:06+00:00", "headline": "Learn bank feeds using top accounting applications from a practicing CPA (Certified Public Accountant)", "description": "<p><strong>Bank Feed Options</strong></p><p><strong>This course will compare and contrast the top accounting software applications, focusing on the use of bank feeds.</strong></p><p><strong>We will provide practice data that learners can import into the software applications.</strong></p><p><strong>Learners will understand the process of setting up each online software package.

It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course.

It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.

A core purpose of the entire management system is to prevent adverse events from occurring. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to understand the risks associated with each activity, interested party, and internal or external factors. Furthermore, such assessments lead to the discovery of new opportunities. </p><p>While analyzing different systems and communicating with interested parties, you will become aware of new opportunities. These can be opportunities for innovation, improved terms, and conditions, investments in new infrastructure, or new training opportunities.</p><p>A foundational concept of quality management is continual improvement.
