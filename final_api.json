Using sample questions to study for your test is the most effective study practice you can use. The advantages of using RMA sample tests include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increasing Your Speed</strong> \u2013 The RMA exam has a three hour time limit. Although most students who take the RMA feel that there is sufficient time, taking the practice tests with self-imposed timers help you budget your time effectively. You should budget approximately 1 minute for each question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Becoming comfortable with the Test Format</strong> \u2013 Every standardized test has its own unique format. As you take practice RMA tests you will become comfortable with the format of the actual test. Once the test day arrives you will have no surprises!</p></li><li><p><strong>Concentrating Your Prep Time</strong> \u2013 As you take more and more sample quizzes you begin to get a feel for the topics that you know well and the areas that you are weak on. Many students waste a lot of valuable study time by reviewing material that they are good at (often because it is easier or makes them feel better). The most effective way to study is to concentrate on the areas that you need help on.</p></li></ul><p>RMA EXAM OVERVIEW</p><p>The RMA certification exam consists of 200-210 questions that count towards your score. All of the questions will be multiple choice questions with four answer options.</p><p>Candidates are given a total of three hours to complete the test. The test topics are based on a national job analysis study that determined the key job components of a medical assistant.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4011302", "category": "Design", "sub_category": "Graphic Design & Illustration", "title": "Cartoon Drawing Course : Angry Mom Driving in Traffic", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Red Jacobs Production", "duration": "3 hours", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "1", "students": "1953", "coupon_code": "63B973CA714998BA5ED3", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4011302_b963_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/cartoon-drawing-course-angry-mom-driving-in-traffic/?couponCode=63B973CA714998BA5ED3", "end_day": "2021-11-29 15:47:17+00:00", "headline": "A step-by-Step Guide to drawing and Coloring a  Cartoon Angry Mom Driving in a Traffic Jam Scene", "description": "<p>This course will help you with the knoweldge on How&nbsp; to Draw&nbsp; and Color Cartoons, with these simplified and easy to follow techniques to <strong><em>enable you become a Professional Cartoonist.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Created by a Amazing Cartoonist ( over 10 years Experience) T.S Amachree</strong> to help you Draw and Color Amazing Cartoons&nbsp; Straight from Your Imagination even with your little experience in Drawing.</p><p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><ul><li><p>How to Draw &amp; Color A Cartoon School Bus</p></li><li><p>How to Draw and Color a Cartoon Car.</p></li><li><p>How to Draw a Cartoon Driver.</p></li><li><p>How to paint a car WindShield.

converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called <em>digital representation</em> or, more specifically, a <em>digital image</em>, for the object, and <em>digital form</em>, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitate processing by digital computers and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.</p><p>Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\". Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organizations around the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Haytham H.

Other people, in other roles, might use Power BI differently.</p><p>For example, you might primarily use the <strong>Power BI service</strong> to view reports and dashboards. Your number-crunching, business-report-creating coworker might make extensive use of <strong>Power BI Desktop</strong> or <strong>Power BI Report Builder</strong> to create reports, then publish those reports to the Power BI service, where you view them.

In this course we will be using a free powerful tool by Oracle called Oracle SQL Developer to migrate a third party database from Microsoft SQL Server into Oracle.</p><p>Database migration involves several steps specified below:</p><p>Setting up a Migration Repository : The Migrations Repository is a database schema that stores the&nbsp;meta_data collected and transformed in the migration process.</p><p>&nbsp;Configuring the Third Party Database Connection&nbsp; : You&nbsp; need to configure a database connection for the database&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp; you would like to migrate. There are two steps to this process:Download JDBC driver and Connecting to Third&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Party&nbsp; Database.</p><p>Capturing Source Database<strong> :</strong>This step is used to capture a snapshot of the current state&nbsp;of your third-party database and is necessary to provide SQL Developer&nbsp; with a \"point in time\" view of your database. Once this step is complete, the Migration wizard works on the meta-data stored in its repository, instead of issuing queries against your live database.</p><p>Convert Captured Model to Oracle<strong> :</strong> The next step in the migration process is to convert the captured model&nbsp;&nbsp;of the database to an Oracle-specific model.&nbsp;</p><p>Translate Third Party SQL Objects to Oracle :The next step in the migration process is to translate the&nbsp;T-SQL objects - constraints, functions, procedures, triggers, views - to Oracle SQL objects.&nbsp;</p><p>Generating Scripts to Create Target Database<strong> </strong>:Once the conversion process has completed, SQL Developer has&nbsp;a model of what the converted database will look like. This is used to generate SQL scripts for the creation of the new Oracle Database schema(s) and to run these scripts.</p><p>Move Data from Third Party Database&nbsp; to Oracle :The last step in the Migration Wizard is to&nbsp; move the data to the new database.&nbsp; Migrating the data is a process that copies the data from the third-party database to the new tables&nbsp;<br>in the Oracle database. The Migration Wizard uses the&nbsp; same Oracle database connection required to run the scripts as it does to move the data.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-10-28_00-27-00-8ce8d50e6635ab46b2d0b2b2dee92ad6/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=lrOvX-pTGYdBh25OLL1JVQ%3D%3D%2C1637881162"}, {"course_id": "3338424", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Affiliate Marketing", "title": "How to Make Money Online for Beginners: Follow PROVEN STEPS!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Roope Kiuttu", "duration": "3 hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "401", "students": "65311", "coupon_code": "C7C857A3F8FDF2BB6E52", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3338424_be0a_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/make-money-online-for-beginners/?couponCode=C7C857A3F8FDF2BB6E52", "end_day": "2021-11-28 16:17:21+00:00", "headline": "Learn How to Make Money Online Starting without ANY Prior Experience!", "description": "<p><strong>Your first $1 online is the hardest.

We are going to learn how to memorize like a spy. Spies have to remember a lot, their life depends on it. </p><p>And some things for such ordinary people like you and I depend on us too, so why don\u2019t we use those spy methods to benefit ourselves?</p><p>While memorizing is sometimes hard, it is possible to make it much easier. Remember what I said about our brain being stubborn? </p><p>Most common reason why you\u2019re not getting much information memorized is that your brain fights back against it and basically says that this and that is boring. There is a way of getting over it, just check out the course!</p><p>We will also be looking at some methods spies use to memorize some pretty important information, and by giving this method to you, you will be able to remember anything you want.</p><p>There is a great variety of ways to memorize info for your studies, your presentations or just for yourself, and we will gladly teach you. One thing you should set out for yourself \u2013 is commitment.

It's what allows you to differentiate yourself from others, showcase your projects and skills, and demonstrate that you can bring something unique to the table. Here are some benefits that every creative professional can enjoy by creating an online design portfolio.</p><p><strong>Increase online visibility</strong></p><p>According to Glassdoor, more and more hiring managers are Googling their applicants before interviews, and not surprisingly, one of the top things they look for is an online portfolio. it\u2019s reassuring to know that you get to decide what comes up on that first page. Will it be pictures of your Friday nights or a professional profile that shows your story and skills? Deck your Google search with social media posts, articles you authored, and most importantly, an online portfolio that showcases the best of your work.</p><p><strong>Open up for potential clients</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re a freelancer, having an online portfolio is the best way to detail your services and open the door wide open for potential clients. This is how Lukas Lienhard, a freelance photographer, attracts clients who wouldn\u2019t have gotten in touch with him if it weren\u2019t for his website. His online portfolio works as a \u201clanding page\u201d for his personal brand, where clients can easily see what his personality, interests, and skillsets are...</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Advantages of a Portfolio</em></strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Online presence</strong> The days of the paper resume are fading fast. Today when employers consider a potential job candidate, a google search is one of the first screening tools they employ. When you have a digital portfolio, you have a powerful tool to shape your online presence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Know what you know</strong> A digital portfolio requires you to write narratives that give details about the skills and experiences that appear on your CV or resume. Writing these narratives gives you a chance to articulate your professional story--the core of your qualifications, the nuances of your professional identity. There's no better preparation for interview questions than creating a portfolio.</p></li><li><p><strong>A deeper look</strong> Today all professionals should have a social media presence. LinkedIn, and Twitter/Facebook. But a digital portfolio goes beyond social media. A digital portfolio lets your LinkedIn profile (and any other social media presence you have) lead colleagues and potential employers to a place where they can explore your career more deeply than any social media profile allows. A job history on LinkedIn--with a link to your digital portfolio added--becomes an in-depth story about your ability to work in a team, lead a project, or innovate in your field.</p></li></ol><p>This is a video course full of real downloadable code examples.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.
