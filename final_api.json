This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. <br><br>The term \u201cScalable Cloud Computing\u201d has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.<br><br>To illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201cInstance\u201d we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.<strong> </strong>This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. <br><br>Similar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,<strong> </strong>virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.<strong> </strong>These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.<br><br>The level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.<br><br>Beyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).</p><p>In addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Exploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Types</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users for EC2</p></li><li><p>Deploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs</p></li><li><p>Assigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Administration </p></li><li><p>Creating Security Groups for Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>Remote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY&nbsp;for Windows.</p></li><li><p>Using EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances. </p></li></ul><p>If you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-10-27_20-31-50-e6a5251fa545b84929c51309cb3cebc2/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1640343391&Signature=LfnX4TBRB9j-wdRvcOwzb1fdVh5UU-XxINTvKzqPhHapueLaQH9lOeaZbanJSTaDV8OC4ySnkJ6TW~E2yAzi9VFeMOXEsaenIF5pl9E7IdEJbeRxDzPnGFMEyeSFE8CGxAIQxgmQmmBfNe8fzAbEWxiVCY7JLPRGkxxzIObQUZ5awEcpa7OGnpEtZ9JivJRvFBShJvow9Rfuw662uUQvykowTTW6RVCKvWLiV~m7F~X55AQqH5VqIFd7HwIR4FlrXClnHzC9NJkniMelxpyi9uZmMqqGAi8wXup1SerHDgHvKzO4f7d87cLHRGCIvoQBrvr8pnsLtufZuCxdWQsWOw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2904002", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Motivation", "title": "How To Achieve Goals Using Less Willpower", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Tim Joshi", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.9", "reviews": "27", "students": "426", "coupon_code": "HOLIDAYGIFT21", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2904002_2fa6_8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tim-joshi-willpower/?couponCode=HOLIDAYGIFT21", "end_day": "2021-12-28 10:09:36+00:00", "headline": "Shift Your Mindset, Goal Strategies, and Energy Levels to Achieve Any Goal (1h of videos + 3h of assessments/exercises)", "description": "<p>In this course, I will take you on a step-by-step journey to have more willpower and use it far more efficiently than ever before.

Here, we discuss the major shift taking place from traditional on-premises IT to the exponential rise in cloud migration. Students will learn the foundations and benefits of cloud computing through the lens of companies like Netflix and Twitter. Over the last decade, these and many other fortune 500 companies have sought to utilize the cloud to unleash its robust capabilities. Statistics indicate that by the end of 2021, cloud data centers will process 94 percent of all IT workloads. It\u2019s also estimated that by 2022 organizations from around the globe will spend close to $400B annually on cloud services. <br><br>Once students have a grasp on use cases and cloud terminology, the course dives into the characteristics of cloud computing, followed by an introduction into the concept of virtualization. Here students learn how software is used to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware, to facilitate the deployment of virtual machines, and scalable cloud resources.</p><p>The modules also include a detailed overview of cloud computing service models including, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), (Platform as a Service), and Software as a Service (SaaS) to illustrate the numerous ways that cloud computing is used in small to enterprise level projects. The course also explores several cloud deployment models including:</p><ul><li><p>Private cloud</p></li><li><p>Community cloud</p></li><li><p>Public vs. Hybrid Cloud</p></li><li><p>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</p></li></ul><p>As students gain familiarity with the integral elements of cloud computing, we explore the rise of AWS as the reigning king of cloud computing services. Students will learn the history of AWS, followed by a number of compelling statistics which illustrate the importance of perusing a career path specializing in the AWS platform.</p><p>The last module of this course offers a hands-on practical guide to establishing an AWS account along with an overview of AWS account basics. This includes exploring the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>AWS Global vs. Regional services</p></li><li><p>Creating AWS Billing alerts</p></li><li><p>Enabling Multi-Factor authentication for account security</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users and Groups</p></li><li><p>Configuring a custom password policy for the AWS account</p></li></ul><p>If you have a passion for cloud computing or foresee yourself working as a cloud practitioner, this course is an excellent place to start.

Therefore, you may have an older version of the software or may work with a client using an older version of the software.</p><p>Along with the most current software, this course will also include demonstrations in older versions of the software so that users can refer them when needed. We will also provide backup files related to older versions of the software that can be used to work through practice problems.</p><p>Note that there are some drawbacks to updating the course each year we want to be upfront about. We think the benefits outweigh the problems.</p><p>The course can feel bloated with content as we work similar demonstrations in new versions of the software. We will add the new content to the top of the course so you can jump right into the newest version. Each version of the software will include at least 25 hours of content once completed which makes it one of the most comprehensive courses you will find.</p><p>Adding new counted each year also makes it a little more difficult to fulfill the requirements for Udemy to provide a certificate of completion. However, you do not need to watch each video to receive the certificate of completion. Once you have finished the portion of the course that relates to you, the rest of the videos can be marked as completed manually, allowing Udemy to issue the certificate of completion.</p><p>This course will start at the basics, assuming you know nothing about the software or accounting.</p><p>We will start by comparing the different versions of QuickBooks. We will then go through the purchasing process, the downloading process, and the installation process.</p><p>The first half of the course will be dedicated to navigating the software, getting a feel for the major components of the software, and the primary accounting cycles such as the customer section or revenue cycle, the vendor section or payments cycle, and the employee section or payroll cycle.</p><p>Once we learn the primary sections or accounting cycles we will analyze the forms and transactions within each section, considering the impact each has on the financial statements.</p><p>The second half of the course will be in the format of a comprehensive problem, working through two months of data impute.</p><p>We will enter every standard type of transaction as we work through the comprehensive problem. The comprehensive problem format will provide context to the data entry process, so we understand how the data impute fits into the accounting workflow.</p><p>A comprehensive problem also allows us to do more than simple data entry, data entry generally being the easiest part of the accounting process. We will be able to see how to set up the system to make the data entry as easy as possible.</p><p>We will also be able to see the impact on the financial statements of every transaction we make and be able to check our work after each transaction.</p><p>QuickBooks backup files will be provided. Backup files allow us to restore a data file and are very useful for learning. Backup files permit us to jump forward in a practice problem and have the data needed to work along with the step by step presentations, having the same data as is in the example presentation, in our system as we start the practice problem. Backup files also allow us to rework a problem or start over if we make an error.</p><p>If a course teaches in the form of a comprehensive problem, the best way to teach, and they do not provide backup files you will need to start the problem with no data and then follow the entire problem without any errors to line up with each step of the example problem being presented. Backup files allow you much more flexibility, being able to jump to future parts of the practice problem or rework any part of the problem.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2020-09-15_01-34-25-4652e2888c5dbee4f405be6132694d23/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=gnPodphdPCnTKtMM4tGpLQ%3D%3D%2C1640343413"}, {"course_id": "2492980", "category": "Photography & Video", "sub_category": "Video Design", "title": "Color Grading and Video Editing with Davinci Resolve 17", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "AK Media", "duration": "42 mins", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "156", "students": "56456", "coupon_code": "77002C984CF86F481422", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2492980_0c85.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/color-grading-and-video-editing-with-davinci-resolve/?couponCode=77002C984CF86F481422", "end_day": "2021-12-27 05:36:31+00:00", "headline": "Learn Video Editing in DaVinci Resolve 17 with Color Correction & Color Grading & Visual Effects", "description": "<p><br></p><p><strong><em>DaVinci Resolve 16&nbsp; Beginners Course </em></strong></p><p>DaVinci Resolve 16 is a free professional video editing application used by professionals and amateurs.

Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company. When you can do both, you can do things that no one else can do and you will be a unique asset in your company.</p><p>There\u2019s a shift under way in large organizations, one that puts design much closer to the center of the enterprise. But the shift isn\u2019t about aesthetics. It\u2019s about applying the principles of design for better user experience. This new approach is in large part a response to the increasing complexity of modern technology and modern business.&nbsp;\n\n</p><p>Most people don't think about how poorly designed everyday interactions are until they learn the principles of good design and user experience, many of which are not intuitive. You don't need to be born thinking about this stuff in order to become a successful designer, it's a skill that can be developed like anything else. Passion often follows from knowledge and expertise.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this course, I have explained the entire design process which when integrated into your product can create an amazing user experience. You will also learn to approach a problem in a systematic manner. Working in a series is the most important stage of the design process. The ability to experiment, to value and learn from mistakes, and build on the experience achieved is the hallmark of a the truly successful and creative individual, whatever the field. \n\n&nbsp; So, what are you waiting for??

This includes HTML, CSS, &amp;&nbsp;Bootstrap. Each section comes complete with comprehensive lessons that help students master the art of front-end coding. </p><p>The course is divided as follows:</p><p><strong>HTML Development</strong></p><p>This section explores HTML. HTML is a key fundamental building block when learning to develop websites. Students initially learn the basics of HTML page structure and gradually transition into working with spacing, text formatting, lists, images, videos, links, anchors, tables, forms and much more. We include several projects, where students are shown first-hand, how to develop and code html web pages from scratch.</p><p><strong>CSS Development</strong></p><p>Students learn to use CSS to create stylish, responsive web page layouts. We start by discussing the parts and types of CSS rules, followed by CSS classes, DIVS, and ID's. Students gain significant exposure to various formatting options, including margins, padding, font properties, backgrounds, transparency, positioning, link styling and CSS tables. This section includes a hands-on web development project where students utilize the concepts explored in the lesson.</p><p><strong>Bootstrap Framework</strong></p><p>Students are taught to use the Bootstrap framework for responsive, mobile-first - front-end development. As one of the leading open-source development libraries, Bootstrap is an essential part of the developers coding arsenal.

Ready to get started on your journey to becoming a local search master?</p><p><strong>WHAT IS LOCAL SEO?</strong></p><p>Local SEO is the art of optimising the online visibility and discoverability of your business, to customers in your physical location. It also helps online potential customers to find out where your business is located, in real life. Local SEO has a lot in common with normal SEO, but includes the promotion of your location information, which you will need to optimise your strategy around.</p><p>When Google ranks websites for Local SEO, it examines normal SEO ranking factors AND a set of unique Local search factors. You need to score highly in BOTH, to do well in Local search.</p><p><strong>GOOGLE\u2019S LOCAL SEARCH RANKING FACTORS:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Where a person is searching from</p></li><li><p>The amount of Name Address Phone Number citations your business has</p></li><li><p>Whether you have a Google My Business listing</p></li><li><p>Your Google My Business Profile Keywords</p></li><li><p>How many positive or negative online reviews your business has</p></li><li><p>What keywords are used in your online reviews</p></li><li><p>How many \u201ccheck-ins\u201d your business has received (and how long people stay at your location)</p></li><li><p>How many times your local business has been shared on social media</p></li><li><p>Your brand\u2019s Google Maps star rating</p></li><li><p>Other behavioural factors like purchases</p></li></ul><p>There are also some other key things you will need to do if you want to be successful with Local SEO, that you wouldn\u2019t have to bother with if you had a purely online brand. For best results, you must optimise for the Google MAP Pack, get visible on relevant local review sites, and use research tools like Yelp and Google Suggest to select the best keywords to pair with your location word. Ultimately, your goal should be to rank high in local search. You can achieve this by following the tips and strategies in this video, and on this course.

You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=lHqoo_jtxf5Jiw6IDJbfug%3D%3D%2C1640343698"}, {"course_id": "3941874", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Contracts Management in Construction Projects", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Akhil Krishna", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "291", "students": "30412", "coupon_code": "CONTRACTS2021", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3941874_73be.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/contracts-management-in-construction-projects/?couponCode=CONTRACTS2021", "end_day": "2021-12-27 11:53:55+00:00", "headline": "Contracts Management, Contract Administration, FIDIC, Bank Guarantees, Contracts, Letter Drafting, Quantity Surveying", "description": "<p>Every construction project is bound by a Contract.
