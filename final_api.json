That means knowing the majority of PRINCE2\u00ae Practitioner content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required.

Dividends for a corporation can be compared do withdrawals from a sole proprietorship or partnership. However, there are substantial differences between a partnership withdrawal and a corporate dividend due to differences in the business structure.</p><p>A partner in a partnership generally has more control over the amount of draws they can take and when they can take them. Different partners may also draw different amounts at different times.</p><p>By contrast, a corporation must give uniform distributions of dividends to each class of shares, resulting in far less direct control by an individual shareholder to determine the amount of dividends or when they will be distributed.</p><p>The dividend distribution policy of a corporate can be very complex, involving many factors, including the life cycle of the company, the cash flow of the company, and the preferences of the shareholders.</p><p>A company that is in the growth phase of its life cycle is more likely to have smaller dividends, preferring to reinvest the money to grow operations. Shareholders who would like to invest over a longer time frame may like this policy because the increase in value of the company will increase the value of the shares.</p><p>A company in a mature phase of the life cycle may not have as much need to reinvest earnings and is more likely to distribute earnings to shareholders.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary.

An optimal state is often a compromise between competing uses and needs to account for long-term sustainability of the soil water system.</p><p>Soil is important for society because it supports plants that supply food, fibers, life-saving drugs and other essentials and because <strong>it filters water and recycles wastes</strong>.</p><p>Soil water conservation <strong>conserves soil moisture in low rainfall areas due to increased infiltration rate and time of concentration</strong>, while in high rainfall areas, it reduces the soil loss. In both situations, it reduces soil erosion, conserves soil fertility and moisture, and thus improves overall crop productivity.</p><p>Agricultural water management (AWM) seeks <strong>to use water in a way that provides crops and animals the amount of water they need, enhances productivity, and conserves natural resources for the benefit of downstream users and ecosystem services</strong>.</p><p>The main objectives for irrigation management or irrigation, in general, is <strong>to promote the proper growth of plants and maintaining the right levels of moisture for the soil</strong>. ...

Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.</p><p>We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.</p><p>The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-06-24_03-07-22-b9a0707f018e7f72b318010bfa0b42a5/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639061072&Signature=eVRS5fV5g-06YxFQmstPKC0nWlS5ncB~tSuUTHAMYwWrxZ8NslTrCHrUvKnsszf842wUkVLEpEb9DQyU57q5r52IyDiMuUspw-Edz0gJsNa1qbtu3QrW~l5fjZ9HzzjSjhEv9dy1YQg~qgNn15io40lKZK5LT6gFwSFJpkLOk76tQMPXACLQC6uUKxXzOzGXnK~uPRsjUrweqRNrFU8MGkZJUkoOXolZP2URMcZKxIU-9BYHhLPKa~hiKSlDAP3BGKD5Ut33sTIFhuRO98nJYr9SEPHJgSzpvrJh5c~338c8jGJy2yuvpkRfgmdUvhxqCGgSErNwIXdRqWF3LUrdxg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4436528", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Ultimate ITIL 4 Foundation Practice Tests 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Youness Labsili", "duration": "", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "949", "coupon_code": "FREE1000", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4436528_98cd.jpg?secure=OAp8AkPTQLatmdy69_KBQA%3D%3D%2C1639131274", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-itil-4-foundation-practice-tests-2022/?couponCode=FREE1000", "end_day": "2021-12-14 00:02:54+00:00", "headline": "Get your ITIL 4 Foundation Certification with the help of these real exam simulations !", "description": "<p><strong><em>In order to set realistic expectations, please note: These questions are NOT official questions that you will find on the official exam.

Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.</p></li><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basics, try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>What is BigQuery used for?</strong></p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong> is a web service from Google that is <strong>used for</strong> handling or analyzing big data. Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform. As a NoOps (no operations) data analytics service, <strong>Google BigQuery</strong> offers users the ability to manage data using fast SQL-like queries for real-time analysis.</p><p><strong>Is BigQuery free?</strong></p><p>For users of Google BigQuery the first 10GB of storage per month is free and the first 1TB of query per month is free. Post these limits, Google BigQuery is chargeable.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p>Google BigQuery is used by companies such as Spotify, The New York Times, Stack Etc.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-06-11_14-32-08-aaf508165050c7dca3ff27c9f3986070/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639061104&Signature=UBBmKRDcGekEKyK5o1GAa-FHC9JKVYQu-KU7PSHWB2YAnYYtZmfpP~lJjSylT0RcwvFOXbfKGoWd7i6qXyS2gRS~iTHRWKgy8QD-WawxhvHgrlMENB-jDyiBWKGwVj4iyP0tCBEo81j5ky~oHcR95yGWrboc0Huu8496C5ec-X9Q8qnC~cLU38MmzuGISw~vnbeUuNXKPOH06qKWKSEA5zvvsKZaGEx~q08o2cu3PEOQLEUzvUsVubqut~yZ0FkKTdF-ylOxHwoGqq50XspYTyyWFiWkjAJrABecfigh7W6~Cak28oD921RHmoeS2xwlrfvCkduQdNu4KXnqQ8cxIg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4236300", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Other Teaching & Academics", "title": "Book of 1 Thessalonians Bible Study & 5 Insightful Lessons", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Boomy Tokan", "duration": "1.5 hours", "rating": "4.9", "reviews": "3", "students": "2427", "coupon_code": "797E8125D7B094BB94B2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4236300_33d4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/book-of-1-thessalonians-bible-study-5-insightful-lessons/?couponCode=797E8125D7B094BB94B2", "end_day": "2021-12-12 17:14:31+00:00", "headline": "In this thought provoking letter you get a sneak preview into Paul's heart as a father & a teacher of end time events!", "description": "<p><strong>Why did Paul write the letter to the Thessalonians?</strong></p><p>To ensure they remained in faith because he was unable to visit them, therefore, he had to send Timothy.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

the needs of both complete beginners and advanced users of QuickBooks Online.</p><p>You can choose to either complete this course from start to finish or jump to the course areas that meet your particular needs.</p><p>Purchasing this course is more of a long-term investment than spending money on most instructional material related to computer software, partly because it is comprehensive, and will continue to meet your needs as you grow in knowledge, and because <strong>we plan on continually updating the course so that it remains relevant even as QuickBooks Online changes over time.</strong></p><p>Online computer applications like QuickBooks Online change their appearance rapidly, making a static course that does not change over time obsolete quickly. We plan on updating this course so that you can continue to use it as a reference even as QuickBooks Online evolves its software. We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online. We will go over each option in more detail in the course.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial, perfect to practice with</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They also often offer a student version, which may provide more extended access to the software, and this would be great considering we will be covering a comprehensive problem.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>QuickBooks also provides a free test drive file.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the course will discuss how to access QuickBooks Online, the accounting software options QuickBooks offers, and set up our QuickBooks file.</p><p>We will then practice navigating the accounting software, the free QuickBooks Online Test Drive File being our primary tool. When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-09-15_01-25-06-3a8c355b7d04a65d32a35037dbca4675/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1641760761&Signature=j~9FH28wGGKPqr9hCuoHprYASE2~E9HdZfybK-bfmdD9G~TeWRhEhcXMB7C8-Ic16l6evWNjQZ~Df-G5Ptf2kzkRm6nqwM9SccpJIMZPVkTcSSFBeF8TJfcuZrsAaKZ-1w4L0G41Fsq0TTyyGFomP2guAxhUNvmjEHF22yDzhibl0iv0G56nTZGB6ZWKsJU9ROahv-V4mBJxfnh58YHmdkIEcha7917fi-HP6Xz4Q-Gimhs7-VS8Wlsed12SFbuLwTtusX7955gT4SJAjF5PB~hXM~epXpfv0OknAmNQUTD98aA49fk2KdFIhEOYEIlt3Bk~ZEo7KEOm9z9Tyl552w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4474394", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Practice Questions For the CCNA 200-301 Exam 2022", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Aymane Benchhab", "duration": "", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "1", "students": "1223", "coupon_code": "A67299AE935435551D01", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4474394_5f89_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-questions-for-the-ccna-200-301-exam-2022/?couponCode=A67299AE935435551D01", "end_day": "2022-01-14 13:07:23+00:00", "headline": "Four Full CCNA 200-301 \u2013 100 Questions/Answer each \u2013  Newest Exams", "description": "<p><strong>Practice Tests</strong></p><p>Those practice exams completely prepare you for what it is like to take in <strong>CCNA 200-301 </strong>Certification Exam .

innovative businesses must focus on growth. Most entrepreneurs focus on money too quickly. But startups must focus on growth, which is why identifying the most important growth and engagement metrics is the most important part of starting an innovative new company.&nbsp; </p><p>When you are working on a true innovation, many aspects of your product business are unknown. That's why it's an innovation. If it was a common business that has been done many times before, your KPIs would be known. But since your startup is building something new, you have to identify the right things to focus on in order to grow the most vital parts of your startup.</p><p><strong>HOW&nbsp;THIS COURSE&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;HELP&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;PERFECT YOUR&nbsp;INNOVATION&nbsp;OR&nbsp;TECHNOLOGY </strong></p><p>Any technology from something simple like a hammer to something complicated like spaceships or computers undergo a series of improvements over time until they get to a desired level of use and quality. No innovation is ideal on its first version so the goal of startup entrepreneurs is to create enough iterations of improvement quickly in order to perfect their product.</p><p>The strategy of this course is to show you how to choose the right things to improve so every one of your improvement iterations makes an impact and helps you grow your startup. The way to choose which features of your startup or innovation to improve is to look at use data, analytics, and identify the right KPIs in order to improve the aspects of your startup that are most vital.</p><p>The flip side of this is that if you choose the wrong features to improve, it won't make an impact and your innovation or startup won't grow. This course will help you succeed by using time-proven, best strategies to help you grow your startup and improve your product or innovation.</p><p><strong>UPDATED&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;2022</strong></p><p>Everything in the course is up-to-date for this year.</p><p><strong>ALL TOOLS&nbsp;SHOWN&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE ARE&nbsp;FREE</strong></p><p>All the tools in the course like Google Analytics are free and standard tools used by startups.

If people had a better disposition, they would have better team coordination, quality would go up, the bottom line would go up, and obviously, success is bound to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that 85% of the time a person gets a job or a promotion is because of the disposition?

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4374622", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Online Education", "title": "Acting course - tools of acting", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ram choudhary", "duration": "44 mins", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "17", "students": "4941", "coupon_code": "OFF100", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4374622_e580.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-acting/?couponCode=OFF100", "end_day": "2022-01-13 22:18:34+00:00", "headline": "Improve your skills in acting.", "description": "<p><br></p><p>In this acting course, Ram Choudhary teach about acting (camera &amp; theater), diction, navras, characterisation, body language, dialogue delivery &amp; importance of backstories ( how to bring real-life experiences into every role and how to build your own characters).
