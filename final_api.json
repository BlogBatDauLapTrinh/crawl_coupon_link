It is the interpretation that helps provide insights after the application of analytical techniques that makes analytics such an important discipline. We have used the most popular analytics software tool which is MS Excel. This will aid the students who have no prior coding background to learn and implement&nbsp; Statistics and Analytics concepts to actually solve real-world problems of Business Analysis.</p><p>Let me give you a brief overview of the course</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 1 - Excel for data analytics</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the first section, i.e. Excel for data analytics, we will learn how to use excel for data-related operations such as calculating, transforming, matching, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.</p><p>We will also cover how to use different types of charts to visualize the data and discover hidden data patterns.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 2 - Statistics foundations for business analysts</strong></p></li></ul><p>Then, in the second section, i.e. Statistics foundations for business analysts, we will start learning about the core concepts of Business Analytics i.e. probability and probability distribution. We will look at important probability distributions used in a business setting such as Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution, Binomial&nbsp; distribution etc</p><p>These concepts form the foundation of data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 3 -</strong> <strong>Statistical Decision making</strong></p></li></ul><p>Once we have covered the basics of probability, in the 3rd section, i.e. Statistical Decision making we will discuss some advanced concepts related to sample testing i.e. hypothesis testing.</p><p>These are the concepts that differentiate a beginner from a pro!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 4 - Optimizing Business Models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the fourth section, i.e. Optimizing Business Models we will learn how to solve common business problems with the help of excel's data analytics tools such as solver, goal seek, scenario manager, etc.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 5 - Preprocessing Data for ML models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn what actions you need to take step by step to get the data and then prepare it for analysis, these steps are very important. We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bivariate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 6 - Linear regression model for predicting metrics</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge on Business Statistics and Business Analysis using MS Excel, and the skillsets of a Business Analyst to immediately see practical benefits in your workplace.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this Statistics for Business Analytics course!</strong></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2351946", "category": "Design", "sub_category": "Graphic Design & Illustration", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Photo Colorisation Tools (2022)", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "40", "rating": "3.6", "reviews": "220", "students": "35479", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2351946_6e01_8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/convert-black-and-white-photos-to-ultra-color-with-ai/?couponCode=FEB-FREE125", "end_day": "2022-05-03 13:53:00+00:00", "headline": "Colorise Photos in Minutes using Artificial Intelligence Tools", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience \"</em>Artificial Intelligence Photo Colorisation Tools (2022)\".</p><p><strong><em>Colours</em></strong> are a vital part of how stories are told through <strong><em>photography</em></strong> and we know this.&nbsp;Now, it's high time to bring <strong>new life to old <em>photos</em> </strong>by automatically applying colour to them with the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;tools.</p><p>This 2022 mind-blowing and incredible course focussed on<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Artificial Intelligence Photo Colorisation Tools\"</em></strong> created by Digital Marketing Legend<strong> \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> teaches you how to leverage Deep Learning to the maximum use in order for colourizing Black and white photos.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement.

Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another.

Make sense?</p><p>Did you think about this, sometimes we pronounce a word wrong and somebody else tells us the correct spelling, maybe we can\u2019t pronounce that word correctly after hearing it once, but in most cases we will be able to pronounce that word correctly after 3-5 times we hear that word, and we are doing this just by hearing.</p><p>Sometimes we feel the need of a little bit of time, just after the full pronunciation of a word, to clearly identify that word. Why this happens is that, our brain trying to match the sound we heard with an existing sound information in our memory. But we did not put that sound information in our memory. In most cases we will be expecting the pronunciation of a word, just like we saw that word on a paper.</p><p>In this course we are going to use some digital tools to improve our listening experience and as a result of listening we are also going to improve our speaking skills. </p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2498008", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Development Tools", "title": "Artificial Intelligence for Civil Engineers (Part 1)- \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbf\u0bb2", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "37", "rating": "3.6", "reviews": "14", "students": "4491", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2498008_40f7_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-civil-engineers-part-1-tamil/?couponCode=15178008E9EF04F4A7BD", "end_day": "2022-04-30 02:37:00+00:00", "headline": "Basic Artificial Intelligence Concepts in Civil (2022 \u0b87\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0b9c\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0b99\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc8 \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc8 \u0ba8\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd)", "description": "<p>\u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc8 \u0ba8\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bca\u0bb4\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0ba8\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b87\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bcb\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb4\u0bc1 \u0b85\u0bb3\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba9 \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc8\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0ba9. \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc8 \u0ba8\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bae\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 (\u0b8f.\u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd.\u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd), \u0ba4\u0bc6\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1 \u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bb0\u0baa\u0ba3\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf\u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb2 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bc7\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0b9c\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0b99\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b95\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b89\u0b95\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0baa\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd. \u0b87\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba9 \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bbf, \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1, \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bc7 \u0ba8\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b87\u0bb3\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b85\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bb5\u0bae\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1 \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd AI \u0bb0\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bcb\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bca\u0bb4\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0ba8\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd.</p><p>We all know that Artificial intelligence (AI) has made an impact in almost every industrial sector, and civil engineering is now joining the stage as well. According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course in Tamil will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Tamil"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4646508", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "PL-900 Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals Practice Exams", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Malika Idokhsan", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "2", "students": "1889", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4646508_890c.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/pl-900-microsoft-power-platform-fundamentals-practice-exams-s/?couponCode=APR2022", "end_day": "2022-05-02 01:13:00+00:00", "headline": "Attend this PL-900 Practice Certification Exam will get a Good Score 80% on Main Exam", "description": "<p>Are you ready to take the 2022 - just out of beta - PL-900 Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals exam?</p><p><br></p><p>This practice test course contains 3 complete timed tests, of at least 50-questions each, just like you will get in the official exam.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3694098", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Strategy", "title": "Facebook Outreach Mastery 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Henry Zhang", "duration": "48", "rating": "3.2", "reviews": "43", "students": "15162", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3694098_128a_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-ads-mini-course/?couponCode=B4F2B0707926E24EA1F4", "end_day": "2022-04-30 23:40:00+00:00", "headline": "How to leverage the power of Facebook ads to reach millions of customers and boost your business success quickly easily!", "description": "<p><strong>The biggest problem with Facebook in recent years is that their organic reach\u2014the people you can reach without spending money\u2014has declined to nearly zero.</strong></p><p>Most people are fans of dozens, if not hundreds of pages on Facebook.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2444066", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Setup a Virtual Web Server using Linode or Digital Ocean", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "duration": "138", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "341", "students": "112895", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2444066_fc28_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/setup-a-virtual-web-server-using-linode-or-digital-ocean/?couponCode=YOUACCEL54142", "end_day": "2022-05-03 02:17:00+00:00", "headline": "Deploy, Configure, and Scale a Production Virtual Web Server on Linode or Digital Ocean.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website. In the special lecture, we will be exploring a tool that allows you to share the recordings as a podcast and monetise them, also.</p><p>Why wait? We advise you to try out the social audio platforms taught in the course, keep an ear out for advertising opportunities, and start thinking about how to engage with your audiences or fans in an audible way - whatsoever.</p><p>1....2....3.....Enroll Now.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear and Logistic Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear and Logistic Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4076184", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Creativity", "title": "Top 5 Secrets for Improving Screenwriting Skills Summary", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Express Skills Academy by James Renua", "duration": "172", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "28", "students": "11615", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4076184_193b_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/top-5-secrets-for-improving-screenwriting-skills/?couponCode=FEB-FREE038", "end_day": "2022-05-03 13:53:00+00:00", "headline": "Ever wanted to know how screenwriters work and learn for yourself?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies.

There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.

Putting aside the excitement of new developments, the convenience that technology may provide is unrivalled. Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It's a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend's Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!! The health and fitness tech business is greatly growing at a breakneck pace, thanks to advances in wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and even mixed reality, making it an exciting time for both customers and developers.</p><p>Oculus stealthily released a fitness tracker called Oculus Move that sits inside its Quest headsets in the final days of 2020. Users who download the software can climb on a ticker hovering above or below their field of view to see how many calories they burn in virtual reality, as well as how many minutes they spend physically active. They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker's dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.</p><p>Apps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of 2022, according to the World Economic Forum. It's a big increase, demonstrating how popular home fitness has become, with hundreds of subscription-based options now accessible. One standout brand has been setting the pace and capitalising on consumer demand called 360 Wellness.&nbsp;360 Wellness is a decentralised and unique live wellness marketplace concept. It's really a robust set of web and mobile applications that connect individuals with health and fitness specialists all over the world. </p><p>Let's now look at what kind of incredible stuff you will be learning in this course titled <strong>\"New-Age Technologies For Fitness Trainers (2022 Edition)\" </strong>that has been created by<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Piyush\".</em></strong></p><p>We will learn that technological advancements continue to have an enormous impact on practically every aspect of our life. People's communication, information seeking, music listening, meal ordering, and shopping habits have all changed as a result of them. We will also discover how technology is creating a huge impact on the fitness businesses and professionals, with even gyms changing how they deliver workout routines. What's more?&nbsp;We will be learning about wearable tech, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;on the fitness industry and unveiling the future of fitness training using the 360 Wellness App. A topic lesson on 3D&nbsp;sports prototypes will ultimately amaze you to the core.

Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Deep Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4335680", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Other Teaching & Academics", "title": "practical bacteriology from scratch", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Mohamed AL ashram", "duration": "57", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "30", "students": "5587", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4335680_fad0_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-bacteriology-from-scratch/?couponCode=1388F3F4A6A949948C40", "end_day": "2022-05-04 09:00:00+00:00", "headline": "you  should know what will you do in lab", "description": "<p>practical bacteriology from scratch&nbsp; </p><p>your safety first&nbsp; &nbsp;take care when working with pathogenic microorganisms wear coat&nbsp; when you are in lab and remove after finish keep the lab disk for equipment only wear gloves when dealing with microorganisms clean&nbsp; clean&nbsp; table before and after test mask eye protect&nbsp; keep your hand away from mouth and eye and nose&nbsp; use mechanical pipetting report the spill and disinfect the area well&nbsp; wash hands after any procedure deal well with fire smooth small one with towel large one use expenditure follow the instructions included in lab safety manual be professional in handling microscope&nbsp; there are many types with many uses bright field microscope&nbsp; dark field microscope phase contrast microscope fluorescent microscope electro microscope&nbsp; it is essential tool practice using the microscope with low power medium power&nbsp; high power and take care when use oil immersion lens sterilization the most important topic in microbiology&nbsp; without keeping your environment sterile it is impossible to obtain Apure culture&nbsp; sterilization methods heat sterilization&nbsp; sterilization by radiation sterilization by disinfectant chemicals&nbsp; &nbsp;use of antimicrobial bacterial culture is a&nbsp; method for isolate bacteria the culture may be natural in origin or synthetic or both culture may be ordinary enriched&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blood agar is enriched media They contain substances Blood ,Serum.

This part starts with a concise conversation of such ideas as wrongdoing, criminal, degenerate, criminal science, law enforcement, and agreement and struggle viewpoints of criminology. The accompanying segment presents an overall rundown of the unique phases of the grown-up law enforcement system, as well as the adolescent equity. The first section of our Criminology and Criminal psychology training presents a general summary of the different stages of the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system. Next, this section illustrates how criminology informs policies and programs. Unfortunately, there are instances when policies are not founded<br>on criminological theory and rigorous research, but are more of an interesting reaction to perceived problems. The second section provides an overview of victimology and various issues related to victims of crime.</p><p>Crime, like so many things in our social world, has a certain taken-for-granted or common-sense nature.

This, of course, is the basis upon which the social world operates on assumptions about the taken-for-granted meaningfulness of the vocabulary we use and the behaviours we enact. The word <em>crime </em>is used regularly in everyday conversation. That it is used in this manner implies that there is a sufficient level of common understanding for it to be meaningful.

Its name refers to how customers distribute knowledge about a product to other individuals as it spreads from one person to another like a viral chain. Viral Marketing is so effective because it generates the interest and desire necessary to create a product or service demand. It is built to produce arousal over nothing. By word of mouth or through online mediums, it builds on itself and is so relevant in all fields of business today. High reputation, low cost, great scope, high productivity and the prospect of continuous promotional changes are the benefits of viral marketing services. The key reasons for viral marketing's broad success are: Socialization and networking have now become much closer to individuals. Social networks are the ideal habitat of this sort of marketing because of their speed and ease of sharing.

Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201cIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201d</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201cNo\u201d to the former and \u201cYes\u201d to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you and uncover all these techniques in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of<strong> </strong>these activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. </p><p><br></p><p>But how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I've spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden on. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a <strong>7-step model \u201cN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System</strong>\u201d. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, daily to extraordinary.

The impact of <strong><em>avatars</em></strong> on education is simply incredible. <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>-guided programs allow <strong><em>teachers like you</em></strong> to train in a <strong><em>virtual</em></strong> classroom.</p><p><strong>What's having an avatar all about?</strong></p><p>An avatar is a figure or character that can be created and customized using cloud-based tools. Avatars can be used for teacher training. Instructional coaches use a virtual classroom to train teachers by helping them master strategies such as questioning at a higher level or managing behaviour. Avatars imitate different types of students to help teachers practice classroom management and relate to their students. The trainee teachers stand in front of a projection screen on which they see avatars that are being controlled, or acted out, by actual students trained to behave a certain way. </p><p>Avatar-guided programs allow teachers to train before real students in a virtual classroom without the risk of making mistakes.&nbsp;Also, creating 3D&nbsp;trainer avatar characters across a school has initial start-up costs as well as fixed and variable costs that can be reduced as the software program is used over time. </p><p>This mind-blowing course teaches you some tools - even apps to create avatars in 2D&nbsp;or 3D for educational or instructional use in your classroom.&nbsp;We will also glance at a real-time 3D&nbsp;animation tool to speed up the animation process to create faster avatar animation - without any technical skills required from your end. </p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Impact on student learning studies conducted by the top universities in the world found that instructor applicants have changed the way they work in the classroom following four 10-minute sessions using avatar-powered platforms like VOKI. <em>Look at the first lecture to understand how to use the VOKI platform.</em></p><p>Students feel more engaged and enthusiastic by imitating the layout of campus and classrooms, even if they learn independently at home. This concept of immersive environments applies not only to universities but also to all kinds of online learning; it allows students to be part of a particular environment rather than feel like they are learning in isolation.</p><p>Avatars increase confidence in information sources, according to a Stanford study, and research shows that when characters guide interactions, people trust the information more than in identical, character-free interactions.</p><p>So, enrol now, there is a lot more to discover here in this course about Robot Teachers or what we call 'Avatars'.</p><p><strong><em>What are you waiting for? There is no time to waste.</em></strong></p><p>There are no technical skills required to learn this course. Nevertheless, the use of cloud-based animation tools and software taught in the course that meets your requirements may be procured by you (if you need) for specific purposes of your choice.</p><p><strong>Let's get busy and start changing your teaching or animation career and life, one step at a time.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1090722", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Growth Hacking", "title": "RoboAuthor: Content Writing Automation 2022 - Part 10", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "82", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "384", "students": "60219", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1090722_71e4_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/viral-content-buzz-boost-your-blog-traffic-by-500/?couponCode=FEB-FREE138", "end_day": "2022-05-03 13:53:00+00:00", "headline": "The tenth course in the RoboAuthor Series that focusses on 'Viral Content Buzz' to make your blog posts go viral", "description": "<p>Virality is not a single attribute.

However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2236090", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Data Science", "title": "ML for Business Managers: Build Regression model in R Studio", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Start-Tech Academy", "duration": "382", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "248", "students": "58477", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2236090_a6f5_6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-basics-building-a-regression-model-in-r/?couponCode=ZXFLAE", "end_day": "2022-05-03 18:00:00+00:00", "headline": "Simple Regression & Multiple Regression| must-know for Machine Learning & Econometrics | Linear Regression in R studio", "description": "<p>You're looking for a complete <strong>Linear Regression course</strong> that teaches you everything you need to create a Linear Regression model in R, right?</p><p><strong>You've found the right Linear Regression course!</strong></p><p>After completing this course <strong>you will be able to</strong>:</p><p>\u00b7 Identify the business problem which can be solved using linear regression technique of Machine Learning.</p><p>\u00b7 Create a linear regression model in R and analyze its result.</p><p>\u00b7 Confidently practice, discuss and understand Machine Learning concepts</p><p>A <strong>Verifiable Certificate of Completion</strong> is presented to all students who undertake this Machine learning basics course.</p><p><strong>How this course will help you?</strong></p><p>If you are a business manager or an executive, or a student who wants to learn and apply machine learning in Real world problems of business, this course will give you a solid base for that by teaching you the most popular technique of machine learning, which is Linear Regression</p><p><strong>Why should you choose this course?</strong></p><p>This course covers all the steps that one should take while solving a business problem through linear regression.</p><p>Most courses only focus on teaching how to run the analysis but we believe that what happens before and after running analysis is even more important i.e. before running analysis it is very important that you have the right data and do some pre-processing on it.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the R environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in R</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture in R where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3411946", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Parenting & Relationships", "title": "\u062a\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0648\u0627\u062c ( \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u062a\u0646\u0642\u0630 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u061f", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Heba Elshamy", "duration": "151", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "14", "students": "2271", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3411946_6545.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tuqvnbbt/?couponCode=BBDE3D517C9796DD5ACF", "end_day": "2022-05-04 17:41:00+00:00", "headline": "\u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0626\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0643 \u0642\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u064a\u062c\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629", "description": "<p>\u0643\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0643 \u0645\u0639 \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0628\u062f\u0642\u0629</p><p>\u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0626\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0629</p><p>\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u062c\u064a\u0645\u0647\u0627</p><p>\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0643 \u0642\u064a\u0645 \u062a\u0631\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0628\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0643 \u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629</p><p>\u0648\u0635\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0627\u062d \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629</p><p>\u0625\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0628\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629</p><p>\u062a\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0631 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628 \u0628\u0625\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635</p><p>\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u064a\u0645\u0629</p><p>\u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 </p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Arabic"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4662252", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect - Practice Exams", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Malika Idokhsan", "duration": "0", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "1", "students": "848", "coupon_code": "08C8EF42D291CA6E0EBD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4662252_aeb1.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/mulesoft-certified-integration-architect-practice-exams-b/?couponCode=FREE1000", "end_day": "2022-05-02 22:13:00+00:00", "headline": "Attend this MCIA Practice Certification Exam will get a Good Score 80% on Main Exam", "description": "<p>A <em>MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect</em> should be able to drive and be responsible for an organization\u2019s Anypoint Platform implementation and the technical quality, governance (ensuring compliance), and operationalization of the integration solutions.

Frankly speaking, it was his marketing genius that set him and his company apart from everybody else on the planet. Now, I would like to re-incarnate Walt Disney into this course and put forth ideas from his perspective, imagining him to be your business coach, after all. What ideas Walt Disney would bring to your table if he lived now?</p><p>Yes, truly it started with a mouse and marketing - in the beginning.</p><p>Walt Disney may have created Mickey Mouse - but none of his success would have been possible without his marketing ingenuity. With the genius in him, he filled up movie theatres, theme parks and sold tons of Disney merchandise. Without Disney, there would be no Disney World and no family entertainment parks. He was the marketing genius for the 20th century!</p><p>While Disney went a bit overboard with his marketing, it's not like he didn't have some great ideas though. Walt Disney had amazing visions, but he was never very good at verbalising them. </p><p>Before that, think of all the big concepts created and promoted today through successful marketing. You should have the mantra that should be branded with your company. Let's take \"Think Different as an example of Apple Inc.\" First introduced in 1997 with this slogan, Apple has transformed into a multimillion-dollar business. The idea is simply to break away from conventional thinking and adapt to technology, customer needs and competition.</p><p>You have all these new ideas in your business, but how do you communicate them to the world? You need an ad campaign to get your idea out there too to reach the masses. Now, let's talk about how this course can be a differentiator when it comes to innovation and thinking like Walt&nbsp;Disney.</p><p><strong>Why enrol for this mind-blowing course \"Innovation 1.0\" that has the power to change the world of innovation forever?</strong></p><p>Your content marketing campaign is vital to the success of your organisation.

Let us elaborate on this further. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously. 'Autonomously' means that the task is not fully controlled by humans and machines play a bigger role in managing or scheduling them.</p><p>Why learn<strong> \"Digishock 2.0:&nbsp;The Ultimate Machine Learning Course of all time\"</strong>?</p><p>This mind-blowing 2022 course - the second course in the series of MBA&nbsp;in Programming and Trending Technologies titled <strong>\"Digishock 2.0: Learn Machine Learning in 2022 (No Coding)\"</strong> taught by Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"Vindhya\"</strong> takes the huge leap from&nbsp;Digishock 1.0 and is for anyone who wants to get introduced to Machine Learning and Deep Learning without learning code, whatsoever.</p><p><strong>\"Digishock 2.0\"</strong> involves hands-on exercises with numerous tricks and techniques of analytics, advanced predictive concepts to work on to ensure that all are familiarised with the discipline of machine-learning, deep-learning, big data, analytics, etc. The USP of the course is that there is no kind of technical knowledge required whatsoever for students who will participate in this course.&nbsp;What's more?&nbsp;We also will cover the topics of how you can create an app in minutes based on any software or application and start the conversion process.

This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.
