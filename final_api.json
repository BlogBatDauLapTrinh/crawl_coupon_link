A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results.

If you want your online freelancing business to <strong>grow</strong>, you should consider leveraging <strong>all aspects of UpWork </strong>while building a strong online presence off the platform. A strong online presence will help you direct more clients to your UpWork profile. That equals more UpWork jobs and money in your pocket!</p><p>You\u2019ve probably been struggling with securing clients on UpWork, especially since competition is rife. There are approximately 12 million freelancers on UpWork. Therefore, you\u2019re probably competing with hundreds of thousands of freelancers in your category. What makes the problem even more real is that freelancers no longer get 50 free connects in the free plan. Connects now have to be purchased and you don\u2019t want to waste money buying connects if you aren\u2019t getting any jobs. The only way to stand out in a sea of competitors is to understand how to effectively brand yourself both on and off UpWork.</p><p>That\u2019s what makes this course different. Not only is it specifically tailored to explaining how to utilize the most recent UpWork features, it also starts by helping you understand how personal branding can help you achieve lasting UpWork success.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement.

The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4292690", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "[2022] Certificaci\u00f3n Oracle Autonomous Database 1z0-931", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Carlos Alberto Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Romero", "duration": "", "rating": "2.5", "reviews": "12", "students": "1648", "coupon_code": "2A3FDBDAEB5ACCA63513", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4292690_22bd_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2021-oracle-autonomous-database-1z0-931/?couponCode=2A3FDBDAEB5ACCA63513", "end_day": "2022-01-12 17:36:41+00:00", "headline": "[2022] Oracle Autonomous Database 1z0-931", "description": "<p><strong>Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud Specialist 1Z0-931</strong> exam simulation is designed for all candidates, including on-premise Database Administrator\u2019s, Consultants, and Cloud data management professionals. who want to apply their knowledge and skills to pass the <strong>1Z0-931(2021)</strong> exam with a 100% Pass Guarantee along with summarizing valuable information.</p><p>Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud Specialist is a must-have certificate for any IT professional working with any cloud technology.

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.</p><p>Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.</p><p>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.</p><p>Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4169782", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Testing", "title": "WebServices testing (RestAssured + Postman) Complete Guide", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Tigran Ter-Karapetyants", "duration": "8.5 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "28", "students": "13826", "coupon_code": "POSTMAN_FREE_JAN", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4169782_c3b3_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/webservices-testing-restassured-postman-complete-guide-learnit/?couponCode=POSTMAN_FREE_JAN", "end_day": "2022-01-12 20:17:54+00:00", "headline": "Learn API testing from zero and build Test Automation framework with minimum toolset: Java, Gradle, JUnit, RestAssured", "description": "<p>Some of you may ask a question like: \u201c<em>Why should I select this course, instead of learning API&nbsp;Testing by myself?</em>\u201d</p><p>So, what is extremely cool about this course?</p><p>You <strong>won\u2019t learn just theory</strong>.</p><p>You will have practical technical tasks to <strong>implement real test applications.</strong></p><p>You <strong>won\u2019t need to search</strong> for answers to your questions <strong>on Google</strong>, because you can't understand lessons or homework.</p><p>Everything is in here.

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.</p><p>Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.</p><p>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.</p><p>Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3912180", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "App android y Sistema para Karaoke en Xamarin Forms", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Franklin Jhon Bustamante Alejandria", "duration": "17,5 horas", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "48", "students": "20299", "coupon_code": "F8FF20AD4E37DB8FF0BD", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3912180_30fd_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/app-android-y-sistema-para-karaoke-en-xamarin-forms/?couponCode=F8FF20AD4E37DB8FF0BD", "end_day": "2022-01-08 15:13:07+00:00", "headline": "Proyecto funcional y terminado", "description": "<p>En este proyecto aprenderas a crear una Aplicacion movil para Karaokes y un Sistema de gestion del mismo.</p><ul><li><p>La aplicacion movil esta desarrollado Xamarin forms usando el lenguaje <strong>C</strong># y patron de software <strong>MVVM</strong></p></li><li><p>El sistema de gestion esta desarrollado en <strong>C# </strong>y base de datos S<strong>QLServer</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Los Temas a ver en la aplicacion movil son:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Modulo de pedidos</p></li><li><p>Modulo de introduccion</p></li><li><p>Animacion de degradados</p></li><li><p>Dise\u00f1os con degradados</p></li><li><p>Listview personalizados</p></li><li><p>Ventanas emergentes personalizados</p></li><li><p>Conexion a SQLServer</p></li><li><p>Creacion de Apk</p></li><li><p>Publicacion de la aplicacion en PlayStore</p></li><li><p>Patron de software MVVM</p></li><li><p>Lector de codigos QR</p></li><li><p>Escaneo de codigo QR para la conexion</p></li><li><p>Pedidos de canciones extras</p></li></ul><p><strong>Los temas a ver en sistema de gestion son:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Modulo de canciones</p></li><li><p>Modulo de pedidos</p></li><li><p>Modulo de mesas</p></li><li><p>Modulo de codigos QR</p></li><li><p>Asistente de instalacion automatizada</p></li><li><p>Creacion de ejecutables portables con base de datos Incluido</p></li><li><p>Dise\u00f1o de interfaces por codigo</p></li><li><p>Arquitectura de software en 3 capas</p></li><li><p>Conexiones encryptadas a SQLServer</p></li><li><p>Escaneo de codigo QR para la conexion</p></li></ul><p><strong>En el 2021</strong> xamarin esta siendo utilizado para aplicaciones robustas y funcionales.

You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}]}
