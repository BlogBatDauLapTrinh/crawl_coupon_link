We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.</p><p>The basics taught in this part will be fundamental in learning time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques on later part of this course.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Basics of Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, we will discuss about the basics of time series data, application of time series forecasting, and the standard process followed to build a forecasting model, time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Pre-processing Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn how to visualize time series, perform feature engineering, do re-sampling of data, and various other tools to analyze and prepare the data for models and execute time series forecasting, time series analysis and implement Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 5 -</strong> <strong>Getting Data Ready for Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment and missing value imputation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 6 - Forecasting using Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 7 - Theoretical Concepts</strong></p></li></ul><p>This part will give you a solid understanding of concepts involved in Neural Networks.</p><p>In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 8 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data.
