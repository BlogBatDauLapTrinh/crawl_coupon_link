You will learn how to setup retargeting and Google shopping (google merchant centre). You will also learn how to create Google ads performance reports with Google data studio. All screen recordings show new Google ads manager layout.</p><p><strong>Setup your Google search campaign today</strong></p><p>Google Ads are a great way to boost your brand profile, generate more leads and traffic, and gain more sales. The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign.</p><p>With this Google Ads course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you'll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed. The strength of advertising with Google lies in its massive market reach and the ability it gives you to create highly targeted campaigns. With Google Ads you can drive quality traffic to your brand, garnered from people searching Google for products and services, similar to the ones you're offering.</p><p>To boost your reach, ads from Google often feature across other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, and the Google Display Network. Another great feature of Google Ads is the Google Ads Analytics dashboard, which allows you to monitor the performance of your ads over time. This helps you hone the effectiveness of your Google Ads and adjust your content and target audience for a more optimal return on your investment. It's definitely worth investing in Google Ads, as even if you're ranking well organically, your results are likely to appear lower than those who have paid to promote. </p><p><strong>Write Google ads copy that people love to click on</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use copywriting strategies that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of Ad Copies are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make Ad Copies sound more specific.</p><p><strong>Choose the right keywords</strong></p><p>Search for words or phrases related to your products or services. The keywords you choose are used to show your ads to people. Select high-quality, relevant keywords for your ad campaign to help you reach only the most interested people, who are more likely to become your customers.</p><p><strong>Optimise your Google ads targeting</strong></p><p>Targeting ads is an essential part of a successful advertising campaign. You may have designed the perfect ad, but you'll need to show it to the right people at the right time to better reach your goal. Google Ads offers different ways of targeting your ads.</p><p><strong>Learn new keyword matching options</strong></p><p>Keywords are words or phrases that are used to match ads with the terms people are searching for. The keyword match types dictate how closely the keyword needs to match with the user\u2019s search query in order for the ad to be considered for the auction. So you could use broad match to serve your ad on a wider variety of user searches or you could use exact match to hone in on specific user searches.</p><p><strong>Use efficiently negative keywords</strong></p><p>Negative keywords let you exclude search terms from your campaigns and help you focus on only the keywords that matter to your customers. Better targeting can put your ad in front of interested users and increase your return on investment (ROI).</p><p><strong>Understand everything about new search terms reports</strong></p><p>Use the search terms report to identify new search terms with high potential, and add them to your keyword list. Look for search terms that aren't as relevant to your business, and add them as negative keywords. This can help you avoid spending money showing your ad to people who aren't interested in it.</p><p><strong>Use auction insights to compare performance</strong></p><p>The auction insights report lets you compare your performance with other advertisers who are participating in the same auctions that you are. This information can help you make strategic decisions about bidding and budgeting by showing you where you're succeeding and where you may be missing opportunities for improved performance. The auction insights report is available for both Search and Shopping campaigns.</p><p><strong>Determine a bid strategy based on your goals</strong></p><p>Google Ads offers several bid strategies that are tailored to different types of campaigns. Depending on which networks your campaign is targeting, and whether you want to focus on getting clicks, impressions, conversions, or views you can determine which strategy is best for you. In this article, we'll describe how to use your advertising goals to choose your bid strategy.</p><p><strong>Improve your Google ppc quality score</strong></p><p>Google uses your PPC Quality Score (QS) to decide how your ad should rank. The higher your quality score, the better your position will be. This score factors in how relevant your landing page and ads are to the keywords you've selected and also assesses your expected clickthrough rate.</p><p><strong>Make use of ad extensions</strong></p><p>Ad Extensions let you supplement your Google ad with one of five additional features for no extra cost. You can select from a Sitelink, Call button, Location info, or App download link, or can choose to showcase an Offer instead.</p><p><strong>Learn Google ads retargeting</strong></p><p>Retargeting is a way to connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app. It allows you to strategically position your ads in front of these audiences as they browse Google or its partner websites, thus helping you increase your brand awareness or remind those audiences to make a purchase.</p><p><strong>Set up Google shopping (Google merchant centre)</strong></p><p>If you're a retailer, you can use Shopping campaigns to promote your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better qualified leads. To get started, you'll send us your product data with Merchant Center and create a campaign in Google Ads. Then, we'll use your campaign to create ads on Google and around the web where potential customers can see what you're selling. We call these placements Shopping ads because they appear in a different, more visual format. In contrast to a text ad, which displays text only, Shopping ads show users a photo of your product, plus a title, price, store name, and more. These ads give users a strong sense of the product you're selling before they click the ad, which gives you more qualified leads.</p><p><strong>Create visual performance reports with Google data studio</strong></p><p>You can add Ad Manager as a data source in Data Studio to create data visualisation reports. The most popular Ad Manager report dimensions and metrics are available.

AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.<br>Ref: &lt;url&gt;</p><p><em>Elastic Load Balancer.</em> <strong>is not correct.</strong><br>Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, Lambda functions, and virtual appliances. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.<br>Ref: &lt;url&gt;</p><p><em>Cloud Trail.</em> <strong>is not correct.</strong><br>Cloud Trail is pefect for this requirement. Unusual activity detection use case: You can detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts by enabling CloudTrail Insights. For example, you can quickly alert and act on operational issues such as erroneous spikes in resource provisioning or services hitting rate limits.<br>Ref: &lt;url&gt;</p><p><em>CloudFront.</em> <strong>is correct.</strong><br>When using Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield Standard automatically provides comprehensive protection against infrastructure layer attacks like SYN floods, UDP floods, or other Reflection attacks. AWS Shield Standard\u2019s always-on detection and mitigation systems automatically scrubs bad traffic at Layer 3 and 4 to protect your application. Over 99% of infrastructure layer attacks detected by AWS Shield Standard are automatically mitigated in less than 1 second for attacks on Amazon CloudFront.<br>Ref: &lt;url&gt;</p><p><strong>See you on the inside <em>(hurry, your practice tests are waiting!)</em></strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "3939436", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Finance", "title": "Corporate Finance #6 Management of Current Assets", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "416", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "30", "students": "20743", "coupon_code": "8F2AF5877870095E7AFE", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3939436_72cf.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-finance-6-management-of-current-assets/?couponCode=8F2AF5877870095E7AFE", "end_day": "2022-04-15 05:19:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn current asset management strategies from a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will discuss how to manage current assets from a corporate finance perspective.</p><p>It will include many example problems, some in presentation format, some using Excel worksheets.

Penny stocks are priced over-the-counter, rather than on the trading floor. The term \"penny stock\" refers to shares that, prior to the SEC's reclassification, traded for \"pennies on the dollar\".</p><p>In 1934, when the United States government passed the Securities Exchange Act to regulate any and all transactions of securities between parties which are \"not the original issuer\", the SEC at the time disclosed that equity securities which trade for less than $5 per share could not be listed on any national stock exchange or index.</p><p>Over-the-counter exchanges that list penny stocks include, the OTC Bulletin Board (which is a facility of FINRA) or OTC Link LLC (which is owned by OTC Markets Group, Inc., formerly known as Pink OTC Markets Inc.). Penny stocks can also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges. Penny stocks can include the securities of certain private companies with no active trading market.</p><p>When considering penny stocks, investors and experts in the field recognize the low market price of shares and its correlation to low market capitalization. Market capitalization or \"market cap\" is the total dollar market value of all of a company\u2019s outstanding securities.</p><p>The volatile nature of penny stocks also leaves these companies open to potential \"manipulation\" by stock promoters and pump and dump schemes. Oftentimes, investors are led to believe that the ability to purchase large quantities of shares at low prices will result in greater returns, which makes them more susceptible.Penny stocks are <strong>high-risk securities with small market capitalizations</strong> that trade for a low price outside major market exchanges. A lack of history and information, as well as low liquidity, make penny stocks riskier.
