However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3619180", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Engineering", "title": "Java Collections Framework + Generics, Lambdas & Stream API", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Andrii Piatakha", "duration": "5.5 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "253", "students": "96944", "coupon_code": "JCF_FREE_JAN", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3619180_1265_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/java-collections-framework-learnit/?couponCode=JCF_FREE_JAN", "end_day": "2022-01-12 19:53:29+00:00", "headline": "Learn Java Collections Framework from scratch to PRO level with practical exercises", "description": "<p>From this course you can learn <strong>Java Collections Framework, together with Generics, Lambda Functions, Method References and Stream API. </strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses in this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding exercises </strong></p><p>To learn programming it is not enough just watching videos and reading books.

The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4482424", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Practice Exams - JAN 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Sanaa Najmi", "duration": "", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "713", "coupon_code": "ANEWYEAR2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4482424_f4e4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/az-500-microsoft-azure-security-practice-exams-jan-2022/?couponCode=ANEWYEAR2022", "end_day": "2022-01-12 20:52:16+00:00", "headline": "Attend this AZ-500 Azure Security Technologies Practice Certification Exam will get a Good Score 80% on Main Exam", "description": "<p>This practice tests course provides practice for taking the real exam and this practice test will help you prepare for the real exam test environment.</p><p>This course will give you lots of practice tests on all topics covered in the AZ500 exam</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>AZ-500 exam covered topics.</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Manage identity and access (30-35%)</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Manage Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identities</em></p><p><em>Manage secure access by using Azure AD</em></p><p><em>Manage application access</em></p><p><em>Manage access control</em></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Implement platform protection (15-20%)</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Implement advanced network security</em></p><p><em>Configure advanced security for compute</em></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Manage security operations (25-30%)</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Configure centralized policy management</em></p><p><em>Configure and manage threat protection</em></p><p><em>Configure and manage security monitoring solutions</em></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Secure data and applications (25\u201330%)</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Configure security for storage</em></p><p><em>Configure security for data</em></p><p><em>Configure and manage Azure Key Vault</em></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Who this course is for:</strong></p></li><li><p>Who want to pass AZ500 Exam</p></li><li><p>Students preparing for the AZ-500 Exam</p></li><li><p>Students who want to assess their exam by testing their exam skills under real (AZ-500) exam simulation.</p></li><li><p>For anyone who want to take their career to a whole new level with an Microsoft certification!</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>pass the AZ500 exam you must know the theory very well but also have high level hands-on skills.

building a small school management system while learning key concepts in ASP.NET&nbsp;MVC development. This course will show you how to leverage MVC's Scaffolding features to quickly construct data driven html pages and how to write queries to the database using .NET's famed Entity Framework with C#. </p><p><strong>UPDATED CONTENT </strong></p><p>.NET Framework is nearing end of support from Microsoft. <strong>.NET 6 </strong>is the latest technology and learning it is made available to you through my course <strong>Complete ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Development. </strong></p><p><strong>Why Learn .NET&nbsp;MVC</strong></p><p>Microsoft .NET is the platform that drives the business technology of many of the top corporations in the United States and many other countries. It is the predominant technology used to drive enterprise-scale business technology. Companies have chosen .NET because for its proven scalability, reliability, and support.</p><p>The .NET language of choice to learn is C#, as it is among the most widely used languages today. It\u2019s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications. As such, there is a high demand across the world for .NET developers in a variety of industries, so that means that more jobs are available for candidates with a foundation built upon .NET technologies.</p><p><strong>About This Course</strong></p><p>In this course, you will also learn how to use Javascript, JQuery and JQueryUI and Ajax to develop dynamic and user friendly user interfaces. All interfaces will be keenly styled using the standard Bootstrap CSS Framework, which is used to maintain a standard look and feel across all pages. </p><p><strong>At the end of this course, you should be able to: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Build a fully data driven web application</p></li><li><p>Understand the MVC Folder Structure</p></li><li><p>Add Data models to your project using Entity Framework</p></li><li><p>Write basic LINQ queries</p></li><li><p>Understand how Models, Views and Controllers combine to facilitate a web application</p></li><li><p>Understand Razor Syntax in views </p></li><li><p>Understand C#&nbsp;Model Classes</p></li><li><p>Understand how to add views and actions to a controller</p></li><li><p>Use Bootstrap to insert JavaScript controls (sliders, etc), button and text styles and manipulate the overall layout</p></li><li><p>Upload a project to GitHub</p></li><li><p>Manage Packages in an MVC Project</p></li><li><p>User JQuery and tools to increase interactivity and animations on the interface.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>To take this course, you will need to have some knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, if not C#. Even if you do not have much exposure to the .NET development stack, this course is very beginner friendly and chock full of development tips. </p><p>This course has over 6 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each module in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.</p><p>By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio and examined logic and syntax errors so much, that it will be second nature for you when working in the .NET environment. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and <strong>impress your boss and coworkers</strong>.</p><p>The course is <strong>complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated</strong>. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.</p><p>Clicking the <strong>Take This Course</strong> button could be the best step you could take towards quickly increasing your income and marketability!

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4325468", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Improving software development productivity", "level": "All Levels", "author": "ANDRII SVIATOBATKO", "duration": "5 hours", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "12", "students": "4647", "coupon_code": "PROD_FREE_JAN", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4325468_3029_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/improving-software-development-productivity/?couponCode=PROD_FREE_JAN", "end_day": "2022-01-12 20:19:25+00:00", "headline": "Improving software development productivity.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients.

Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android.

In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!
