Information has <em>never</em> been more valuable and the huge surge in demand for digital based brands makes online content a valuable commodity. Copywriting skills are needed in almost every area of marketing. Even if you produce mostly video content, you still need an engaging description that tells potential viewers what your clip is all about. Copywriting can boost your search engine results, help you build trust with your followers, and can convert your subscribers into active buyers.</p><p><strong>Learn Website Creation</strong></p><p>Optimising your website is still an essential step you must take, to show people that your business is reliable and reputable. Luckily, these days you don\u2019t have to understand complex coding or pay someone an exorbitant fee to enhance your website, so it loads fast and is optimised for mobile devices. Now, with easy-to-navigate interfaces you can get your website sleek and streamlined, all by yourself. There\u2019s also no need to pay anyone to create a website for you, unless you want to. Remarkable platforms like WordPress and Wix enable you to launch a professional looking website in just a few clicks.</p><p><strong>Learn Conversion Rate Optimisation</strong></p><p>Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) refers to the process of optimising your website to maximize the amount of people that take the desired action you want, like signing up for your newsletter or making a purchase on your website. As you might have guessed, the \u201cConversion\u201d part happens whenever people take the specific action you desire. If you run an E-Commerce site for example, a conversion would be when people buy one or more of your products. If you\u2019re a blogger, a conversion could be a sign up to your email newsletter.</p><p><strong>Learn Video Marketing</strong></p><p>Do you find you\u2019re creating great content but still not getting the audience you want? If so, it\u2019s highly likely you\u2019re not creating the <em>right </em>sort of content, as the way people consume content, and the type of content they consume is changing rapidly. To survive, you must evolve your own content creation strategy, to make sure you\u2019re using the right tools, and using them correctly, and in all the right places. </p><p><strong>Learn YouTube Marketing</strong></p><p>YouTube is a vital tool for your brand, as over 80% of all shared online content is now in the video format. One of the first things you can do to optimise your YouTube views is to customize your video thumbnail. According to YouTube's own statistics, 9 out of 10 of the most-viewed videos on YouTube used a bespoke thumbnail. Thumbnails are BIG, but not just any thumbnails. For maximum results, use bogy thumbnails, made up of four colours, Blue, Orange, Green, and Yellow.</p><p><strong>Learn TikTok Marketing</strong></p><p>TikTok's users typically spend around 52 minutes per day on the app, which boasts an average engagement rate of 29%. TikTok is solely video focused, and the platform allows users to post short clips, edit them, then post them to their followers. With more than 90% of users logging in multiple times a day and sky-high user engagement levels, TikTok is rapidly becoming a platform that marketers need to target.</p><p><strong>Learn Email Marketing</strong></p><p>Email Marketing is a vital part of any online marketer's toolkit. This is because email marketing provides you with a direct link to an already interested, targeted subscriber base. However, it\u2019s important to do it right, as if you spam your potential customers they\u2019ll switch off and quickly unsubscribe. To retain as many subscribers as possible and turn them into paying customers, you need to give them valuable content they want to help them gain trust in your brand.</p><p><strong>Learn SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</strong></p><p>SEO is critically important to your online marketing success, as nearly 60% of all traffic on the web starts with a Google search. If you add in the traffic originating from other major search engines, like YouTube, Facebook Bing, and Yahoo!, this figure is even higher, with 71% of all traffic coming from search! Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the art of getting targeted traffic to a website or page, from a search engine\u2019s organic rankings. SEO includes creating high-value content, optimising that content around specific keywords, and building high authority backlinks. The trick to winning with SEO is to optimise your site for the search engine you want to rank highly on, whether that\u2019s Google, Bing, Amazon, or YouTube. You must make sure a search engine sees your site as the best answer to a person\u2019s search. How the different search engines determine the \u201cbest\u201d result is based on a unique algorithm that evaluates several different factors, including quality of content, backlinks, uptime, traffic, and speed.</p><p><strong>Learn Google Search Console</strong></p><p>Improve your performance on Google Search. Search Console tools and reports help you measure your site's Search traffic and performance, fix issues, and make your site shine in Google Search results. Optimise your content with Search Analytics. See which queries bring users to your site. Analyze your site's impressions, clicks, and position on Google Search. Submit sitemaps and individual URLs for crawling. Review your index coverage to make sure that Google has the freshest view of your site. Receive email alerts when Google identifies issues on your site. See which URLs are affected by these issues and tell Google when you\u2019ve fixed them. Understand how Google Search sees your pages.</p><p><strong>Learn Local SEO</strong></p><p>Local SEO is becoming an increasingly important factor, as 46% of all searches in Google have a \u201clocal intent\u201d. According to Google, \u201cNear me\u201d searches have grown at an even faster rate, 150% more than normal, local-based searches. With 74% of all consumers who search for a local product or service going on to visit a store that <em>day,</em> you'll want to get in on the action.</p><p><strong>Learn Google Maps Rankings</strong></p><p>Google's MAP pack is a set of 3 local business results with a map of their locations pulled from Google Maps, that's given to users who search for a business near them. It's also displayed when Google thinks it's relevant, even when users haven't used a local search location, so it is an important factor you need to consider.</p><p><strong>Learn Facebook Marketing</strong></p><p>Facebook's best use for digital marketers is as a platform to raise awareness of your brand, build followers, and boost customer loyalty. Make sure all your content is carefully targeted to your main follower demographic, so you are posting only what people want to read about and learn about. Use visual or video to compliment your text posts and make sure you use a killer cover photo of your local business. Try posting competitions and fun polls to up follower engagement and consider using your Facebook Timeline to share your brand's history and tell your story.</p><p><strong>Learn Customer Journey on Social Media</strong></p><p>Another factor you must consider is the 3 Stage Customer Journey to Purchase. The Customer Journey can be compared to a relationship, in a relationship the goal is to get commitment, but in this case the commitment you are seeking is to get the customer to buy.</p><p><strong>Create Facebook Business Page</strong></p><p>First, make sure your Facebook Business Page cover stands out with an appealing picture or engaging video. Use your page to tell a story about your brand and state what you\u2019re offering and what you do clearly. Make sure you\u2019ve connected your Facebook Business Page to your Instagram Profile, so you can harness the full power of both platforms.</p><p><strong>Setup Facebook Business Manager Account</strong></p><p>In Business Manager you'll find Facebook Ads Manager, catalogue feeds, and the Facebook Pixel events manager. Here you'll also be able to set up and control custom and lookalike audiences for smarter targeting and retargeting.</p><p><strong>Setup Facebook Pixel Correctly (Including Conversion API)</strong></p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel correctly on your website is critical if you want to convert, but though many websites offer full Facebook Pixel integration, most people still fail to do a complete setup. It's not enough to just copy and paste the Facebook Pixel code, you also need to use the Event tool on Google Chrome to get the maximum out of this Facebook feature. Mark customer events like clicking on the Contact button, searching for a product or location, or initiating checkout. In later videos, you'll learn how to correctly setup the Facebook Pixel in easy-to-follow step by step detail.</p><p><strong>Learn Facebook Ads</strong></p><p>Facebook is a vital tool for your brand, but it's no good just jumping on and posting away or chucking money at Facebook Ads and hoping for the best. The secret of Facebook success is having great content combined with precise targeting and smart retargeting. There are some crucial things you must do to position your brand to thrive on Facebook, or you'll just be wasting your time, or throwing money away on Ads that won't perform.</p><p><strong>Learn Dynamic Retargeting</strong></p><p>The most powerful types of Facebook Ads are Dynamic Ads, also known as catalogue sales. These allow you to retarget your website visitors dynamically, according to the content they've been viewing on your website. They also enable you to retarget people who\u2019ve begun but not finished the checkout process. Dynamic Ads are an incredibly potent retargeting tool and require automated synchronisation with E-Commerce platforms like Shopify.</p><p><strong>Learn Instagram Marketing</strong></p><p>If you have products or services you\u2019d like to promote, Instagram marketing can help you grow your following and get more custom. The site is the world\u2019s most popular photo sharing platform but to get the most out of it, you need to know what kind of posts your target audience prefers. Instagram offers you different types of marketing approaches, from paid sponsored ads to free user generated content. Before you post anything, choose the approach that best fits your budget, the size of your audience, and the goals you want to reach for each post.</p><p><strong>Learn Instagram Ads</strong></p><p>Now you can advertise on Instagram through Facebook\u2019s advertising platform, which gives you total control over your Insta ads. You can target how they appear, and who views them, and post directly from your own Instagram account. There are five types of Instagram Ads you can run through the Facebook platform and these include:</p><ul><li><p>Photo Ads</p></li><li><p>Video Ads</p></li><li><p>Slideshow Ads</p></li><li><p>Story Ads</p></li><li><p>Carousel Ads</p></li></ul><p><strong>Learn Messenger Ads</strong></p><p>Messenger ads work just like ads across other Facebook platforms. Facebook automatically deliver ads to the placement that's most likely to drive campaign results at the lowest possible cost. The best part? You can use the same creative for Messenger that you're already using for Facebook and Instagram.</p><p><strong>Learn Influencer Marketing</strong></p><p>Use the power of popularity to turbocharge your brand. Influencers carry serious weight on social and in the blogosphere, with the most popular celebrity influencers like Kylie Jenner enjoying followers in the 100\u2019s of millions. Not all influential people on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are celebrities though, yet their endorsement could be just as, if not more valuable to your brand.</p><p><strong>Learn Chatbot Marketing</strong></p><p>Chatbots can help you save time, money, and precious staff resources, and can be deployed to assist with nearly everything, from online commerce to customer service. You might worry that directing your customers to a bot instead of a live person may put them off, but bots can actually be a great way of keeping users on your site and retaining their interest. Research has discovered that 69% of customers favour talking to a chatbot over a real person, primarily because of speed and efficiency.If you want to use bots to your best advantage though, you first need to make a structured plan which addresses key elements you must assess before you can create a bot users will engage with.</p><p><strong>Learn LinkedIn Marketing</strong></p><p>LinkedIn is a vital platform for marketing because its members typically drive 4 out of 5 of all business decisions taken. The most-used social media platform amongst Fortune 500 companies, LinkedIn's audience has double the buying power of normal web audiences, making it a crucial place for B2B lead generation. You can use LinkedIn in a targeted way to promote awareness of your brand to key decision makers. To get started, you\u2019ll need to sign up and create an account, optimise your profile, and create an effective company profile.</p><p><strong>Learn Pinterest Marketing</strong></p><p>Pinterest\u2019s active user base grew by 26% to in the past year with 77% of weekly pinners now saying they've discovered a new brand or product on the platform. Pinterest is a useful platform you can use to promote any sort of content, including text-based articles, providing they have an image you can pin. It also has its own loyal user base, who frequently use the platform to make purchasing decisions. 90% of Pinterest users say they search out content on the platform before they make a commitment to purchase.</p><p><strong>Learn Twitter Marketing</strong></p><p>You can use Twitter to achieve a variety of objectives, whether you want to humanise your brand, build buzz, expand your reach, or provide fast customer support. Before you do anything on Twitter, you need to lay out a clear plan. You need to decide what you want to achieve and make sure all your content on the platform aligns with this objective.</p><p><strong>Learn Quora Marketing</strong></p><p>Quora is primarily a question and answer platform but it\u2019s also a social network where users discuss a huge variety of topics. It offers a great, if overlooked marketing opportunity, which many people aren\u2019t aware of. Users on Quora can manage their profiles and connect with others with common interests, but the main idea behind the site is for people to get <em>expert </em>answers to their questions.</p><p><strong>Learn Reddit Marketing</strong></p><p>Reddit can be a difficult platform to crack if you\u2019re marketing a product, brand, or service but if you can do well, there are some very worthwhile great benefits. The platform is <em>super-hot </em>on banning accounts that over-promote, and major brands such as Business Week have been banned from the Platform for promotion by moderators. The primary reason to use Reddit to promote is for Brand Building, as the platform is a highly effective way of using word of mouth to introduce a new concept, idea, or hot topic. If you can provide valuable information, an expert view, or are doing something differently you could use this to stimulate discussion.</p><p><strong>Learn Podcast Marketing</strong></p><p>The popularity of Podcasts is growing fast, with an average of 32% of adults in the US alone, listening to at least one podcast in the past month. This percentage has grown by 10% compared to a decade ago. Research conducted by Nielsen shows that podcast listeners come from an ideal consumer demographic for many marketers, as they tend to be relatively affluent, young, and highly educated. Advertising via podcasts is extremely cheap, especially when compared to radio ads or TV. This makes it a great way to promote your own content, attract a bigger following, or get the word out about your business, product, or service.</p><p><strong>Learn Google Ads, Youtube Ads, Bing Ads &amp; Google Retargeting</strong></p><p>Google Ads are a great way to boost your brand profile, generate more leads and traffic, and gain more conversions. The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically, it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign. With this course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you\u2019ll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed.</p><p><strong>Learn Google Shopping (Google Merchant Centre)</strong></p><p>Another thing you want to make the most of is the suite of tools offered by Google Merchant Centre, which allows you to upload and update your product information, including images and pricing. This information will then be displayed in relevant Google Shopping searches. Merchant Centre is integrated into other Google services, like Google My Business, giving you the opportunity to completely control all your Google-based marketing and E-Commerce. To sign up for Google Merchant Centre, you need a Google Account, and a verified website and business verified by Google My Business. Your e-commerce platform must also offer the ability to sync data with Google Merchant Centre.</p><p><strong>Learn Google Analytics</strong></p><p>Google Analytics is an absolutely essential tool if you're promoting an e-commerce site or running any kind of business online. With Google Analytics dashboard, you can view all your data including traffic stats in one spot. This is one of the most vital tools in your marketing armory as you can discover so much useful information that will allow you to optimise, adjust, and improve.</p><p><strong><em>With Google Analytics you can:</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>See how people visit your website and where your visitors are located in the world</p></li><li><p>Discover if your website is mobile optimised and how many of your visitors are discovering your site from mobile devices</p></li><li><p>Find out which websites are sending traffic to your page</p></li><li><p>Discover which of your marketing campaigns are driving the most traffic to your website</p></li><li><p>Learn which pages on your website are the most viewed</p></li><li><p>See how many of your site visitors have converted into leads or customers</p></li><li><p>Find out where converting visitors came from and where they go after visiting your site</p></li><li><p>Learn how to improve and optimise your website's speed</p></li><li><p>See what blog content your visitors like the most</p></li></ul><p><strong>Learn Heat Maps</strong></p><p>Heat Map tools like Crazy Egg and Hot Jar allow you to easily visualise complex statistical data. They show you one image that encapsulates everything you need to know about where visitors are clicking on your webpage, what actions they are taking, how long they spend on your page, and with what content. This is great for discovering strong and weak points of your site and can also help you identify hard-to-navigate areas that you can change.</p><p><strong>Learn Brand Building</strong></p><p>Brand Building is the process of establishing a solid brand identity, that evokes a set of values people instantly connect with your business. It also includes raising consumer awareness of your company and what you do, as well as reaching out to expand your audience. You can enhance your brand\u2019s equity, or value, by creating promotional strategies and campaigns that raise your company profile. One of the best tactics for growing a brand is repetition, showing up in front of the right people helps solidify you as a viable choice for consumers.</p><p><strong>Learn Growth Hacking</strong></p><p>Growth Hacking refers to strategies that expand your company\u2019s influence, sales, and reach. Typically, Growth Hacking techniques are used by start-ups on limited budgets, who want to achieve significant brand growth over a short period of time. The ultimate purpose of any Growth Hacking strategy is to get as many new customers or users as fast as possible, while spending a minimum amount.</p><p><strong>Learn Product Marketing</strong></p><p>Product Marketing differs from conventional marketing because it focuses on the lifecycle of a product as well as the product user, whereas conventional marketing\u2019s goal is to drive conversions and generate sales. Product Marketing is also used to generate new product pipelines by identifying consumer demand and interest. The two can complement each other, as conventional marketing can help you get more exposure, while product marketing helps make your product more appealing.</p><p><strong>Get your First Digital Marketing Job</strong></p><p>In this complete section, we\u2019ve outlined the most effective actions you can take to secure your first paid digital marketing assignment if you want to work as an SEO consultant, Facebook or Instagram Ads Consultant, content creator, copywriter, or in other related roles.

Being fully nomadic means being able to work when you want, where you want and how you want \u2014 on a business that fuels you, drives you and is usually tied to a deeper passion <em>within</em> <em>you </em>rather than working for someone else's dream. Being fully nomadic means being able to live and work from anywhere, and getting to sample tastes of the world and immerse yourself in cultures, traditions, new places and experiences that can evolve your soul exponentially more in one year abroad than five years staying in the same place. There is no one definition of nomadic lifestyle because it's something that can only be determined by the person living it. Maybe you want to travel the world full-time as a digital nomad, or maybe you want to have a home base and travel a few times a year. </p><p><strong>Find High Value Clients</strong></p><p>You won\u2019t only get clients, but you\u2019ll learn how to value yourself and demonstrate this so that you can charge way more for what you do.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.

These and other cognitive functions are performed by the vastly interconnected neural networks formed by the roughly 100 billion neurons of the brain. The precise patterns of connectivity among neurons within these networks determines their function, and through experience, these connectivity patterns change over time to enable acquisition of new skills. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of brain function is the ability to learn new cognitive skills, such as the ability to understand and speak a foreign language. During learning, connections between neurons change through a process known as synaptic plasticity, which plays a pivotal role in learning, While traditional learning brings about changes in neural networks through experience, synaptic plasticity can also be enhanced by activating neuromodulatory regions in the brain via peripheral neurostimulation. This program seeks to use peripheral neurostimulation to facilitate the release of neurotransmitters associated with components of learning, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, we can leverage endogenous neuronal circuitry to enhance learning by accelerating the tuning of neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.</p><p>Recent success with this approach has been demonstrated in clinical rehabilitation studies, utilizing peripheral neurostimulation delivered through implanted electrodes.

The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates.

Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you.

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Hindi"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4390890", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Data Science", "title": "Python for Deep Learning: Build Neural Networks in Python", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Meta Brains", "duration": "124", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "226", "students": "49734", "coupon_code": "38D6C862F61E3FB3A9DC", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4390890_a964_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-basics-with-python/?couponCode=77986AD14EBFEE99A929", "end_day": "2022-05-28 08:00:00+00:00", "headline": "Complete Deep Learning Course to Master Data science, Tensorflow, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Networks", "description": "<p>Python is famed as one of the best programming languages for its flexibility.

They help us answer three questions: What do I want to change about myself, How do I change,&nbsp; How do I commit to changing, Whether it\u2019s being a better lawyer, a leader or manager or whether it\u2019s more personal, such as getting in shape, losing weight, being a better parent, change starts with identifying what you want to change about yourself, figuring out how to get from here to there and making that change a reality. Life coaches help you do this. They help you to get to know yourself better, define what you really want and work with you on how to get it. Successful individuals set goals and pursue them. When we feel stuck, we\u2019re in a rut, or we find ourselves asking, How did I get here? we know we need to make a change, but we have difficulty defining the change and have less of an idea of how to make it.&nbsp; life coach helps you answer these questions.</p><p>A life coach can lead you to water but can\u2019t make you drink. A life coach can help you devise a plan, but he can\u2019t execute the plan.&nbsp; life coach can give you the tools, but won\u2019t build the house for you. The hard work\u2014getting up every morning and working toward your goals every day, in both small and big ways\u2014that\u2019s all you.&nbsp; life coach will help you design the blueprint, but you mix and pour the concrete, saw the wood and build.</p><p>This is where most dreams fail. This is where the best of intentions only get you so far. This is where it\u2019s you changing, ever so incrementally, step by step, inch by inch, making a new you. Your life coach can offer advice, motivation and inspiration but you\u2019re the one on the field. You\u2019re the one running and hustling, blocking and tackling, throwing and receiving, making the moves and making the plays. In short, a life coach is just that a coach</p><p>a life coach helps you figure things out, but once you have strategy, it\u2019s up to you to execute. he\u2019s not there to hold your hand or carry you across the finish line. he helps you be the brains of the operation. good life coach has a process for you to follow to determine what you want to change, how to change it and how to stick with it through the end. You two are co-architects and you\u2019re the contractor.</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1905626", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Transformation", "title": "Control Your Subconscious Mind: Neuroscience Hidden Secrets", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Dr. Vijender Goel", "duration": "145", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "228", "students": "35026", "coupon_code": "38D6C862F61E3FB3A9DC", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1905626_c5c0_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/master-your-brain-to-achieve-your-desired-success/?couponCode=MAY2022FREE001", "end_day": "2022-05-27 14:22:00+00:00", "headline": "The ULTIMATE Neuroscience Blueprint to UNLOCK and UTILIZE your subconscious mind.
