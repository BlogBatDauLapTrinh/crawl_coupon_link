Frankly speaking, it was his marketing genius that set him and his company apart from everybody else on the planet. Now, I would like to re-incarnate Walt Disney into this course and put forth ideas from his perspective, imagining him to be your business coach, after all. What ideas Walt Disney would bring to your table if he lived now?</p><p>Yes, truly it started with a mouse and marketing - in the beginning.</p><p>Walt Disney may have created Mickey Mouse - but none of his success would have been possible without his marketing ingenuity. With the genius in him, he filled up movie theatres, theme parks and sold tons of Disney merchandise. Without Disney, there would be no Disney World and no family entertainment parks. He was the marketing genius for the 20th century!</p><p>While Disney went a bit overboard with his marketing, it's not like he didn't have some great ideas though. Walt Disney had amazing visions, but he was never very good at verbalising them. </p><p>Before that, think of all the big concepts created and promoted today through successful marketing. You should have the mantra that should be branded with your company. Let's take \"Think Different as an example of Apple Inc.\" First introduced in 1997 with this slogan, Apple has transformed into a multimillion-dollar business. The idea is simply to break away from conventional thinking and adapt to technology, customer needs and competition.</p><p>You have all these new ideas in your business, but how do you communicate them to the world? You need an ad campaign to get your idea out there too to reach the masses. Now, let's talk about how this course can be a differentiator when it comes to innovation and thinking like Walt&nbsp;Disney.</p><p><strong>Why enrol for this mind-blowing course \"Innovation 1.0\" that has the power to change the world of innovation forever?</strong></p><p>Your content marketing campaign is vital to the success of your organisation. You will know that the way you present your company's brand shapes people's views of your organisation. Times may have changed since Walt Disney's days but his marketing ideas are still an element of brilliance. Let's take a look at a few tactics from Walt Disney\u2019s angle to push your business idea to success.)</p><p>In the superb course, you will learn how Walt Disney would think about any idea about a product/service. We will be focussing on Disney\u2019s creative strategy which has the root cause of the success of the company and of course, Walt Disney, the man, the myth and the legend - himself.</p><p>I guarantee that this course is unlike any course you\u2019ve ever taken. It definitely helps in showcasing the most fantastic and absurd ideas possible from Disney\u2019s perspective and also focuses on how you can apply the same principles of Walt Disney to enjoy renewed and continuous business success.</p><p><strong>Welcome to My Class and Evoke the Brilliance of Disney</strong></p><p>Enrol now.

AI is an analysis of how the machine is thinking, studying, determining, and functioning when it is trying to solve problems.</em></strong></p><p>These kinds of problems are present in all fields, the most emerging ones, and even beyond. The aim of Artificial Intelligence is to enhance machine functions relating to human knowledge, such as reasoning, learning, and problems along with the ability to manipulate things. For example, virtual assistants or chatbots offer expert advice. Smart robots or robot advisors will provide instant research or findings in the fields of finance, insurance, law, the media, and journalism, and medical diagnosis and support will be provided by AI software on the health front. Other advantages include increasing productivity dramatically in research and development programs by reducing time to the market, enhancing the transport and supply chain networks and improving governance by improved decision-making processes etc.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technology is aiding the following prominent fields for 2022 and many others:</p><p>Website Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to create websites and landing pages in merely minutes.</p><p>App Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to automate the whole concept of creating apps.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) \u2212 This process is simulating the actual interaction with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.</p><p>Expert Systems \u2212 Learners and users will be provided with guided information and advice on the computer or software.</p><p>Vision Systems \u2212&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;systems in 2022 can understand, explain and describe the computer's visual input to the ultimate core.</p><p>Spoken Word or Speech Recognition \u2212 Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based speech recognition systems are capable of listening, voicing and recognizing the user input - i.e. when a person speaks with them. Alexa, Siri and Google's assistant, are examples of this function. </p><p>Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help users to create and experiment with machine learning models and build data science applications in a flash. </p><p>Video Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate video production and cut high costs of hiring resources and teams as everything is taken care of in the cloud. </p><p>Python and Coding tools - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate writing lakhs of lines of code in python and even Java or PHP&nbsp;in minutes without the need for a human coder or even someone who will debug the code.

The answer to these questions is a \"No\".</em></strong></p><p>The development and eventual growth in AI apps helping in productivity will provide workers with a range of opportunities to improve their skills and concentrate on creative aspects. Stating additional forecasts, disruptive market trends are highly likely to occur in the AI Expansion period (i.e. 2025-2030), the opportunity for employment would require a high degree of personalization, innovation or ability tasks which will still require a person to perform them (even though the AI robotic tools have actually speeded up the process). These occupations or technologies are difficult to imagine at this stage, yet these occupations will rapidly increase as new specialization is required when the demand would kick in.

Flutter is an SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so-called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces.</p><p><strong>Flutter is extremely trending</strong> and gets used for major Google apps like their Adwords app - it's now marked as \"ready for production\", hence now is the time to jump in and learn it!</p><p>This course will teach Flutter from scratch, NO prior knowledge of either of the two is required! And you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.</p><p>You'll learn Flutter not only in theory but<strong> we'll build a complete, realistic app</strong> throughout this course. This app will feature both all the core basics as well as advanced features like using Google Maps, the device camera, adding animations and more!</p><p><strong>With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play.</strong></p><p>Use Google's Material Design to build beautiful, yet fully customizable, apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more - or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too.</p><p><strong>Here's what's included in the course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Detailed setup instructions for&nbsp; Windows.</p></li><li><p>A thorough introduction to Flutter and the concept behind widgets.</p></li><li><p>An overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones</p></li><li><p>Page navigation with tabs, side drawers and stack-based navigation</p></li><li><p>State management solutions</p></li><li><p>Handling and validating user input</p></li><li><p>Connecting your Flutter app to backend servers by sending Http requests</p></li><li><p>User authentication</p></li><li><p>Using native device features like the camera</p></li><li><p>Adding beautiful animations &amp; page transitions</p></li><li><p>Image Upload</p></li></ul><p>And more!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course is for you if ...</strong></p><ul><li><p>You're interested in building real native mobile apps for the two most popular mobile platforms - iOS and Android</p></li><li><p>You want to explore the full set of features Flutter offers</p></li><li><p>Don't want to spend hours learning two completely different languages</p></li></ul>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Arabic"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4536228", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Strategy", "title": "ESG Reporting for Businesses", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Americana Chen", "duration": "158", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "42", "students": "4973", "coupon_code": "APR.2022", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4536228_6e91_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/esg-reporting-for-businesses/?couponCode=9ED9DDCE902CE0DF2423", "end_day": "2022-05-05 01:12:00+00:00", "headline": "ESG Reporting - from beginner to expert", "description": "<p>The course will extend from the fundamental of Corporate ESG and elaborate on 6 aspects related to ESG in greater depth, including</p><ul><li><p>Global Landscape;</p></li><li><p>Standards &amp; Frameworks;</p></li><li><p>The reasons and benefits of ESG reporting ;</p></li><li><p>Contents and Elements of good ESG Reports;</p></li><li><p>The current challenges in ESG reporting;</p></li><li><p> Trends going forward.</p></li></ul><p>After completing the first section, you should be able to understand the differences and similarities between different frameworks and standards, the compatibility of frameworks, selecting the ones that are most suitable for your business based on geographical location, corporate vision and strategy, your product, the main audience of your ESG report and the aspect of ESG that is most important to your business, and finally understand how to apply the frameworks as a starting point of writing ESG report for corporations.</p><p>Implementation of Greenhouse Gas Accounting Tools and the Sustainable Development Goals will be further elaborated.</p><p>In section 2, we will identify 9 reasons for ESG reporting and explain each of them with cases, such as significant financial loss due to lack of ESG considerations</p><p>We will then make reference to how rating agencies assess corporate ESG and several global frameworks, to explore the contents and principles of ESG reporting.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

The impact of <strong><em>avatars</em></strong> on education is simply incredible. <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>-guided programs allow <strong><em>teachers like you</em></strong> to train in a <strong><em>virtual</em></strong> classroom.</p><p><strong>What's having an avatar all about?</strong></p><p>An avatar is a figure or character that can be created and customized using cloud-based tools. Avatars can be used for teacher training. Instructional coaches use a virtual classroom to train teachers by helping them master strategies such as questioning at a higher level or managing behaviour. Avatars imitate different types of students to help teachers practice classroom management and relate to their students. The trainee teachers stand in front of a projection screen on which they see avatars that are being controlled, or acted out, by actual students trained to behave a certain way. </p><p>Avatar-guided programs allow teachers to train before real students in a virtual classroom without the risk of making mistakes.&nbsp;Also, creating 3D&nbsp;trainer avatar characters across a school has initial start-up costs as well as fixed and variable costs that can be reduced as the software program is used over time. </p><p>This mind-blowing course teaches you some tools - even apps to create avatars in 2D&nbsp;or 3D for educational or instructional use in your classroom.&nbsp;We will also glance at a real-time 3D&nbsp;animation tool to speed up the animation process to create faster avatar animation - without any technical skills required from your end. </p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Impact on student learning studies conducted by the top universities in the world found that instructor applicants have changed the way they work in the classroom following four 10-minute sessions using avatar-powered platforms like VOKI. <em>Look at the first lecture to understand how to use the VOKI platform.</em></p><p>Students feel more engaged and enthusiastic by imitating the layout of campus and classrooms, even if they learn independently at home. This concept of immersive environments applies not only to universities but also to all kinds of online learning; it allows students to be part of a particular environment rather than feel like they are learning in isolation.</p><p>Avatars increase confidence in information sources, according to a Stanford study, and research shows that when characters guide interactions, people trust the information more than in identical, character-free interactions.</p><p>So, enrol now, there is a lot more to discover here in this course about Robot Teachers or what we call 'Avatars'.</p><p><strong><em>What are you waiting for? There is no time to waste.</em></strong></p><p>There are no technical skills required to learn this course. Nevertheless, the use of cloud-based animation tools and software taught in the course that meets your requirements may be procured by you (if you need) for specific purposes of your choice.</p><p><strong>Let's get busy and start changing your teaching or animation career and life, one step at a time.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4662252", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect - Practice Exams", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Malika Idokhsan", "duration": "0", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "1", "students": "1341", "coupon_code": "APR.2022", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4662252_aeb1.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/mulesoft-certified-integration-architect-practice-exams-b/?couponCode=MAY2022", "end_day": "2022-05-06 02:44:00+00:00", "headline": "Attend this MCIA Practice Certification Exam will get a Good Score 80% on Main Exam", "description": "<p>A <em>MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect</em> should be able to drive and be responsible for an organization\u2019s Anypoint Platform implementation and the technical quality, governance (ensuring compliance), and operationalization of the integration solutions.

from experience. Let us elaborate on this further. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously. 'Autonomously' means that the task is not fully controlled by humans and machines play a bigger role in managing or scheduling them.</p><p>Why learn<strong> \"Digishock 2.0:&nbsp;The Ultimate Machine Learning Course of all time\"</strong>?</p><p>This mind-blowing 2022 course - the second course in the series of MBA&nbsp;in Programming and Trending Technologies titled <strong>\"Digishock 2.0: Learn Machine Learning in 2022 (No Coding)\"</strong> taught by Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"Vindhya\"</strong> takes the huge leap from&nbsp;Digishock 1.0 and is for anyone who wants to get introduced to Machine Learning and Deep Learning without learning code, whatsoever.</p><p><strong>\"Digishock 2.0\"</strong> involves hands-on exercises with numerous tricks and techniques of analytics, advanced predictive concepts to work on to ensure that all are familiarised with the discipline of machine-learning, deep-learning, big data, analytics, etc. The USP of the course is that there is no kind of technical knowledge required whatsoever for students who will participate in this course.&nbsp;What's more?&nbsp;We also will cover the topics of how you can create an app in minutes based on any software or application and start the conversion process.

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1682352", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Data Science", "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing + Live Class", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "501", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "1234", "students": "141366", "coupon_code": "APR.2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1682352_73b4_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-in-digital-marketing/?couponCode=D9BAC2665C310482D969", "end_day": "2022-05-07 02:05:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn incredible Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing Automation Tools in 2022", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience</em><strong><em>&nbsp;\"Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing - Gold Edition 2022.\"</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong> has transformed the virtual panorama, inclusive of Google\u2019s RankBrain personalising suggestions by Amazon.

There have been two tremendous AI advances: search engine optimisation and revolutionised net searches. The voice seeks and Google\u2019s set of new rules and RankBrain are the opposite AI improvements, as discussed earlier. Some different innovations which can be widely used nowadays encompass, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana make it convenient for human beings to carry out searches by simply urgent a button or pronouncing a voice command.</p><p>AI-based CRM (customer relationship management) tools make it convenient to maximise the gathering of consumer details and facts from special technologies utilised and this process can be fully automated too. It additionally helps to gain unique insights into target audiences and identify customers\u2019 needs so that groups can establish the most suitable advertising strategy.</p><p>This behavioural data makes it easy for the brands to apprehend clients\u2019 temper. For instance, the kinds of products someone buys, pages they browse, which gear they regularly use, etc. With all of these accrued facts, marketers can without problems examine a capacity client's needs, and adapt AI used to grow income.</p><p><strong>A note on&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Digital Marketing (2022 Gold Edition)&nbsp;- The Course</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;game-changing&nbsp;course taught in 2022 will cover<strong>&nbsp;artificial intelligence tools in content creation, curation, augmented reality,</strong> and digital marketing and will take you on a glimpse into the future.

The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.</p><p>One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it. The ability to use it to improve digital marketing strategies and valuable customer insights for companies will be the same as it continues to advance.

The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

So, if you want to create an unforgettable first impression, it is very important that you prepare yourself with the correct tools and techniques before you even go to meet the person in question whom you want to impress or go to the event/interview.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked this one question to the many decision-makers all over the world \"If you would like to see the change that will make your organization more productive, what would it be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody came back with one word and they said ATTITUDE. If people had a better disposition, they would have better team coordination, quality would go up, the bottom line would go up, and obviously, success is bound to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that 85% of the time a person gets a job or a promotion is because of the disposition? ONLY 15% depends on how intelligent they are or how many facts and figures they know.</p><p><br></p><p>And almost 100% of the education dollars go to teaching facts and figures which accounts for only 15% of the success, and what we are talking about in this course is 85%.

Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is through the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.
