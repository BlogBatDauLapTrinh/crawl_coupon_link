And I would love to share what I have learned with you in this course I designed especially for those who're trying to make a film by themselves, with a limited budget, and trying to get it seen. No matter if you're just starting out or you are an experienced filmmaker already, there's always something to learn. </p><p>I also do daily vlogs on YouTube where I\u2019m constantly trying to motive and inspire a new generation of filmmakers to come, and showing filmmaker\u2019s life the way it is.</p><p>This course also includes agreement templates for your independent film.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "2512030", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Audit - Financial Statement", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "1098", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "1317", "students": "53468", "coupon_code": "3226CC89CE9778109855", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2512030_67fb.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/audit-financial-statement/?couponCode=3226CC89CE9778109855", "end_day": "2022-04-10 05:20:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn the audit process from planning to audit report form a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).", "description": "<p>Audit-Financial Accounting will discuss, in detail, the auditing process of financial statements.</p><p>The course will start by discussing what an audit is, as well as what the terms attest engagement and assurances services mean.</p><p>We will discuss the audit environment, the general format of a public accounting firm, and the general format of an audit team that would conduct the procedures related to an audit. The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1.

I\u2019m <strong>Pradeep Prajapati</strong>, your Instructor for this course. I know you are facing problems in your life for managing the most valuable <strong>asset of your life,</strong> and that asset is <strong>your time</strong>. In this course you will learn </p><p>This course lays a common frame of understanding by exploring what people believe about time management, enumerating the benefits of time management, formally defining the term <strong>time management</strong>, briefly going over the history of time management, and showing how time management can lead to success.</p><p>I will also teach you about <strong>Setting Goals</strong>, which will help you in setting a clear direction by establishing values, visions, and goals. When values, visions, goals, and actions are congruent, the results will be in line with expectations</p><p><strong>Task Management,</strong> is the cornerstone of time management. Earl Nightingale said that time cannot be managed except through the control of activities. I have created a separate section for task management which will shows you how activities can be managed by making lists, prioritizing, and pruning. This section also shows how dependent actions and sequences of actions can be managed together.</p><p>We will also cover the biggest problem of human life <strong>Managing Daily Tasks </strong>, this section will shows you how to manage the day's activities. It is important to know how much time is available and how long any task will take in order to make a realistic list of tasks for the day. This sets achievable expectations.</p><p><strong>Deadline Management</strong>, focuses on getting things done on time. deadline management ensures that you do something by a given time. Deadline management addresses issues and obstacles that prevent on time completion of tasks. These issues include Parkinson's Law, procrastination, Murphy's Law, and risks.</p><p>Section 7, <strong>Overcoming Obstacles to Productivity,</strong> covers tactics to get work done quickly and with fewest errors. This includes dealing with interruptions and distractions. It also covers areas of self-discipline such as preparation, organization, delegation, and accepting responsibility.</p><p>Section 8,<strong> Measuring Your Time Management Skills,</strong> shows how to measure the effectiveness of time management. It is said that if you cannot measure it you cannot manage it. The metrics covered in this chapter show productivity, effectiveness, efficiency, and quality. Metrics boost self image and allow you to take pride in your achievements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I guarantee you. This is the only course you need to become super productive. If you feel that you have not learned a valuable skill in this course then you can take your money back because this course comes with a 30 days money back guarantee.

Sounds interesting?? Let\u2019s go ahead and learn what this is all about\u2026</strong><br></p><p>Let me ask you a few questions? Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods.

For example, virtual assistants or chatbots offer expert advice. Smart robots or robot advisors will provide instant research or findings in the fields of finance, insurance, law, the media, and journalism, and medical diagnosis and support will be provided by AI software on the health front. Other advantages include increasing productivity dramatically in research and development programs by reducing time to the market, enhancing the transport and supply chain networks and improving governance by improved decision-making processes etc.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technology is aiding the following prominent fields for 2022 and many others:</p><p>Website Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to create websites and landing pages in merely minutes.</p><p>App Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to automate the whole concept of creating apps.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) \u2212 This process is simulating the actual interaction with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.</p><p>Expert Systems \u2212 Learners and users will be provided with guided information and advice on the computer or software.</p><p>Vision Systems \u2212&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;systems in 2022 can understand, explain and describe the computer's visual input to the ultimate core.</p><p>Spoken Word or Speech Recognition \u2212 Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based speech recognition systems are capable of listening, voicing and recognizing the user input - i.e. when a person speaks with them. Alexa, Siri and Google's assistant, are examples of this function. </p><p>Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help users to create and experiment with machine learning models and build data science applications in a flash. </p><p>Video Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate video production and cut high costs of hiring resources and team as everything is taken care of in the cloud. </p><p>Python and Coding tools - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate writing lakhs of lines of code in python and even Java or PHP&nbsp;in minutes without the need for a human coder or even someone who will debug the code.

It is also about developing empathy and our ability to form deep relationships with others.</p><p>What is an emotionally intelligent child like?</p><p>Children who have developed their emotional intelligence are aware of their feelings and have developed the vocabulary to name the feelings they are experiencing; usually able to understand what has caused them to feel a certain way and explain it. As well as to develop strategies to deal with the feelings in an appropriate way; able to take other people's feelings into account in other situations.</p><p>Anyone who has tried to think clearly when they are upset, angry or very excited will understand how much power emotions can have over us. Emotions are a part of being human and our toddlers, children and adolescents need help and support to equip them with the tools to deal with their big feelings. All emotions are important and there is no shame to be had from feeling different emotions but, it is the way that children release those emotions that can be problematic for parents and carers and create power struggles. Understanding, labelling and being in control of emotions leads to happier children who feel safe and secure.</p><p>Ignoring or denying how your child feels can cause further upset. As parents, it is natural to sometimes try to be positive when children are feeling negative emotions by telling them 'not to worry' or 'it'll be OK. However, although well-intended, this is a contrast to your child's emotional state and can lead to them feeling misunderstood, affecting your connection with your child. Instead, try mirroring and labelling your child's emotion for them with a calm tone of voice and empathy.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "2457052", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Governmental Accounting 300 Proprietary & Fiduciary Funds", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "968", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "30", "students": "24982", "coupon_code": "59CF951374566175294F", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2457052_1bcd.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/governmental-accounting-300-proprietary-fiduciary-funds/?couponCode=59CF951374566175294F", "end_day": "2022-04-10 05:22:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn governmental fund accounting focusing in on proprietary funds (internal service & enterprise) and fiduciary funds.", "description": "<p>Governmental Accounting 300 Proprietary &amp; Fiduciary Funds will focus in on the accounting for proprietary and fiduciary funds.</p><p>We recommend first taking Governmental Accounting 100 and Governmental Accounting 200 or have equivalent experience before taking this course.</p><p>The course will provide an overview of governmental accounting.
