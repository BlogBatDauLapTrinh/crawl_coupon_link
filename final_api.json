Sounds interesting?? Let\u2019s go ahead and learn what this is all about\u2026</strong><br></p><p>Let me ask you a few questions? Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey. Being a parent I know the toughest thing is to have your child express their feeling to you. We have covered this most important aspect of creative self-expression through different exercises and fun methods.</strong>&nbsp;</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4479772", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Stress Management", "title": "Stress-free Effective Learning for Adults: Crush your goals!", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Dr. Marcel Tella Amo", "duration": "95", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "25", "students": "3609", "coupon_code": "9044C76D5119DA0C3D57", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4479772_5c1a_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/fun-and-effective-learning/?couponCode=A9501322DBF0377C9539", "end_day": "2022-05-11 11:08:00+00:00", "headline": "Become a superlearner! - Complete practical training in learning:  Avoid procrastination, and increase productivity", "description": "<p>This course on <strong>how to learn </strong>is designed with <strong>life-long learning</strong> in mind for you to <strong>become a superlearner</strong>.

An accounting system using special journals can reduce data input by limiting the amount data needed to be input for each transaction due to the format of the special journal. Special journals can also eliminate the need to post each transaction to the general ledger. Rather than posting each transaction to the general&nbsp;ledger special journals are added up at the end of the period and one transaction is then posted for the entire period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Special journals are typically used in a manual system but understanding them helps any system because it helps to see what components of an accounting system are necessary to all accounting systems, which components can be changed, and when changing the format of the system would be beneficial.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android.

There are different busbar electrode combinations, there's a different voltage range and conductor gap information, there's information about the box, the height, the width, and the depth, and how they use that enclosure box to calculate the instant energy levels. There's the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we'll talk about that as well. Grounded versus ungrounded systems, the two-second rule cut off where that is, and as well as what's next? what goes above and beyond this 2018 standard?<br><br>So, stick around you'll expect to learn a lot from this standard and from this course.

Architecture principles and clean code design in OOP applications", "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>GoF Design Patterns with detailed Java examples.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course!

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company!

But does that mean it\u2019s something experienced editors should ignore? Not necessarily.

Zielgruppe sind (zuk\u00fcnftige) F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte, Projektleiter/innen, Personen mit Leitungsfunktionen oder einfach alle Menschen mit Verantwortung im Job.</p><p>Ich habe sowohl wissenschaftliche Inhalte als auch meine eigene Erfahrungen als Trainer, Coach und F\u00fchrungskraft in diesen Lektionen eingebaut. Dadurch erhaltet ihr einen guten \u00dcberblick \u00fcber das die wichtigsten Instrumente der Personalentwicklung, was eure Professionalit\u00e4t als Personalentwickler/in oder/und F\u00fchrungskraft ausbaut und festigt.</p><p>In diesem Kurs werden wir uns mit folgenden Inhalten besch\u00e4ftigen:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Einf\u00fchrung in die Personalentwicklung:</strong> Neben der Definition von Personalentwicklung geht es auch darum, einen guten \u00dcberblick \u00fcber diese Disziplin zu bekommen. Desweiteren wird eine Abgrenzung zu Organisationsentwicklung und Coaching vorgenommen und die m\u00f6glichen Zielgruppen definiert.</p></li><li><p><strong>Managementtheorien</strong>: Damit sie notwendigen Zusammenh\u00e4nge und Entwicklungen besser verkn\u00fcpfen k\u00f6nnen, bekommen Sie in diesem Kapitel einen kurzen R\u00fcckblick in die Historie. Gleich danach widmen wir uns \u00fcberblicksm\u00e4\u00dfig den neueren Organisationsformen wie Scrum und Holokratie. Auf die Eignung von agilen Methoden wie auch auf die selbstorganisation von Unternehmen und Hierarchie und Rollen gehen wir ebenfalls ein.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leadershipkonzepte</strong>: In der Personalentwicklung als F\u00fchrungskraft oder Personaler/in sind sie auch Expertin oder Experte f\u00fcr F\u00fchrungskonzepte. Dazu lernen Sie die fundamentalsten Ans\u00e4tze kennen damit Sie im F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte-Coaching diese Anwenden k\u00f6nnen. Neben der fachlichen Vermittlung geht es auch um ein Grundverst\u00e4ndnis wie F\u00fchrung funktioniert und wie sie diese Konzepte in der eigenen Organisation umlegen k\u00f6nnen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Managementdiagnostik: </strong>In diesem Abschnitt werden Sie diverse Ans\u00e4tze zur Messung von Anforderungen und Profilen kennenlernen. Dazu werden wir Anforderungen an F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte und Managemendiagnostik durchnehmen. Neben der Differenzierung von F\u00fchrung und Management geht es um die Aufbereitung der Messungen. Weiters geht es um das Konzept der Mitarbeitergespr\u00e4che und wie Selbsteinsch\u00e4tzung von F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte f\u00fcr die Personalentwicklung eingesetzt werden kann. Wir schlie\u00dfen dieses Kapitel mit einer Selbstreflexion mit dem Johari Fenster ab.</p></li><li><p><strong>F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4ftecoaching</strong>: Als F\u00fchrungskraft und/oder Personalentwickler/in werden Sie h\u00e4ufig Mitarbeiter/innen und/oder F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte auf ihren Weg begleiten. Dazu lernen Sie die Grundbausteine der Prozessberatung kennen. Ebenso werden wir die Consultinganteile im Coaching besprechen und widmen uns den typischen Managementaufgaben. Mit dem notwendigen Hintergrundwissen und dem Kennenlernen von den 10 Management-Rollen k\u00f6nnen Sie auch die verschiedensten Anl\u00e4sse f\u00fcr Coachings besser zuordnen. Im Anschluss daran geht es um die Auftragskl\u00e4rung, die sowohl im kleinen als auch im gro\u00dfen Kontext obligat ist. Der Dreieckskontrakt ist im FK-Coaching \u00f6fters anzutreffen, weshalb wir die Eigenheiten dazu besprechen. Im weiteren Verlauf geht es um die Unterscheidung von externen und internen Coaches wie auch F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte als Coaches. Am Ende der Lektion wird noch auf etwaige Fallen im FK-Coaching eingegangen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Systemisches Coaching - Eine Expresseinf\u00fchrung</strong>: Dieses Kapitel soll Ihnen einen groben \u00dcberblick \u00fcber das systemische Coaching verschaffen. Da dieses Thema so umfassend ist, habe ich einen kurzen Auszug aus meinem seperaten Kurs \u201cSystemisches Coaching - der komplette Kurs\u201d zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt. Falls sie sich hier vertiefen m\u00f6chten, lade ich sie herzlich ein, bei dem weiterf\u00fchrenden Kurs vorbeizuschauen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recruiting:</strong> Recruiting ist ein \u00dcberbegriff, welcher sowohl die Personalbeschaffung und auch Auswahl beinhaltet. Je nach Vorerfahrung k\u00f6nnen Sie sich in diesem Kapitel mit biografischen, eigenschaftsorientierten Verfahren auseinandersetzen. Ebenfalls gehen wir auf Assessment-Centers ein und wie sie dieses Konzept auch im kleineren Unternehmen umsetzen k\u00f6nnen. Neben vielen Beispielen gehen wir auch auf Hearings ein. Im Anschluss darauf geht es um das Onboarding wie auch Outplacement, welches f\u00fcr ein gelungenes Employer Branding unumg\u00e4nglich ist. </p></li><li><p><strong>Kennzahlen in der Personalentwicklung:</strong> Als (zuk\u00fcnftige) Entscheider/in brauchen sie datenbasierte Entscheidungsgrundlagen. Dazu sollten sie ein Grundverst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die g\u00e4ngigsten Kennzahlen aus der HR-Branche mitbringen. In dieser kurzen Lektion werden Sie ein paar Beispiele aus der Praxis mitbekommen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mitarbeiter/innen-Befragungen</strong>: Fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter werden Sie in ihrerer Arbeit als F\u00fchrungskraft mit Befragungen konfrontiert werden. Egal ob sie diese nur Begleiten, weil Sie sich eine externe Beratung einkaufen, oder die Befragung selber Durchf\u00fchren, in diesem Kapitel werden wir auf die Ziele, Planung und Durchf\u00fchrung n\u00e4her eingehen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Employer Branding</strong>: Das Employer Branding ist schon lange keine Modeerscheinung mehr. Beinahe jede Personalabteilung hat bereits EB-Projekte umgesetzt oder will zuk\u00fcnftig noch mehr Initiativen dahingehend unternehmen. In dieser Lektion werden sie neben der Definition und Abgrenzung zu Marke und Branding auch noch erste Umsetzungs-Empfehlungen mitbekommen. Je gr\u00f6\u00dfer das Unternehme ist desto mehr werden Sie sich auch mit Talentemanagement besch\u00e4ftigen, was wir ebenfalls abdecken.</p></li></ol><p>Mit diesem Online-Kurs bekommen Sie strategische Handlungsempfehlungen f\u00fcr die Personalentwicklung die Sie f\u00fcr ihr eigenes Unternehmen umsetzen k\u00f6nnen.</p><p>Sichere dir deinen Wissensvorsprung und schreiben Sie jetzt gleich in diesen Kurs ein.</p><p>Ich freue mich auf Sie im Kurs.</p><p>Viele Gr\u00fc\u00dfe<br>Markus Edenhauser, MA MSc</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "German"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4336510", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Microsoft AZ-104: Azure Administrator Exam Prep Test", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Debajyoti Adhya", "duration": "0", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "25", "students": "10737", "coupon_code": "9044C76D5119DA0C3D57", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4336510_4f43_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-az-104-azure-administrator-exam-prep-test/?couponCode=60FEA62BD3A27086E656", "end_day": "2022-05-09 22:10:00+00:00", "headline": "Pass AZ-104 Cloud Certification Exam 165Q Practice Set", "description": "<p><strong>Get Yourself Certified and earn a Cloud Skill.</strong></p><p>Three separate Timed Test of 55 questions each.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

He is widely regarded as the <strong>Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha</strong> (Grandfather of Telugu song-writing).</p><p><strong>Tallapaka Annamacharya</strong> was born on <strong>Vaishakha Shuddha Pournami</strong> in the year Sarwadhari (22 May 1408) in Tallapaka, Near Rajampet Mandal, a village in present-day Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh, India.Even though his parents belonged to the Nandavarika Brahmin community of Smarta tradition, he took initiation into Vaishnavism and became a Vaishnava in the Vedanta Desika Sampradaya. His wife, Timmakka, had written <em>Subhadra Kalyanam</em>, and is considered the first female poet in Telugu literature. Their son, Pedda Tirumalacharya, and grandson, Tallapaka Chinnayya, were also composers and poets. The Tallapaka compositions are considered to have dominated and influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. Annamacharya lived for 95 years until Phalguna Bahula (Krishna) Dvadasi (12th day after full moon) in the year Dhundhubhi (4 April 1503).</p><p>Annamayya is said to have composed as many as 32,000 sankeertanas (songs) on the praise of lord Venkateswara of which only about 12,000 are available today. He is also the author of musical treatise called <em>\"Sankirthana lakshanamu\"</em>.</p><p>Annamayya considered his compositions as floral offerings to Venkateswara. In the poems, he praises the deity, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara. His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma (spiritual) and Sringaara (romantic) <em>sankeertanas</em> genres. His songs in the \"Sringaara\" genre worship Venkateswara by describing the romantic adventures of Venkateshwara and his consort Alamelu, while others describe the <em>Bhakti</em> of his devotees.</p><p>In his later keertanas, he espouses subjects such as morality, dharma and righteousness. He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latter's color, caste and financial status, in his songs \"<em>Brahma\u1e43 Okkat\u0113 Para\u1e25brahmamokkat\u0113</em>\" and \"<em>\u0113 kulaju\u1e0dainan\u0113mi evva\u1e0dainan\u0113mi</em>\". His prodigious literary career earned him a place among the all-time greats of Telugu literature.</p><p>While he enjoyed popularity in his days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries. Mentioned in 1849,they were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala, just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room. An English translation of 150 of these verses was published in 2005.</p><p>Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, also known as TTD, has been endeavoring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions. In the year 1950, The State Government of Andhra Pradesh created a committee and appointed the legendary musician late Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna as its head. He set music to over 800 compositions of Annamacharya and are still popular among the devotees. He was the <em>\u0100sth\u0101na G\u0101yaka</em> of the Tirumala temple at Tirupati for two decades. He is regarded as a legend in rendering devotional music in classical style, especially the Annamacharya Sankirtanas. He was also an acclaimed poet, singer, and a musicologist. In 1979, the legendary singer Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi's album Balaji Pancharatna Mala came up with Annamacharya keerthanas like Vande Vasudevam, Bhavamulona, Sriman Narayana and many more. This became a hit and took the compositions of Annamacharya to every nook and corner of the country</p><p>Shobha Raju is the first recipient of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams scholarship in 1976 to study and set a trend for the propagation of Annamacharya's compositions, and was also chosen as the first exclusive artiste for the propagation of Tallapaka's compositions in 1978. Her first audio album, \"<em>V\u0113nkat\u0113\u015bvara G\u012bta M\u0101lika</em>\" is globally popular among Telugu community. She is the founder of Annamacharya Bhavana Vahini (ABV) in 1983, which is located in Hyderabad, India. She has been awarded Padmashri by Government of India, in 2010 in recognition of her efforts to promote Annamayya Compositions. Sri Garimella Balakrishna Prasad, a Carnatic music exponent and the asthana vidwan of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has set tune to more than six hundred songs written by Annamacharya, gave audio recordings for TTD, published books with musical notations and conducted classes, teaching the songs to make them more popular.</p><p>In 1994, reputed Bharathanatyam artist Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala, also the daughter in law of the legendary singer Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao, for the first time produced and presented a mammoth dance production as a tribute to the divine composer titled \"Annamaiyah\". Rare and popular songs were woven into a story format and music by legendary stalwarts was set to action. This production was inaugurated by the former President of India R. Venkatraman and Bharat Ratna-winning singer M. S. Subbulakshmi and later that year for the Tirumala Brahmotsavam. The production went on to become a sensational hit and more dancers of different forms started choreographing for the saints' composition. Based on popular demand in 2009, a DVD of the production was also launched which included several places visited by the saint himself. The production has traveled across the US, Europe, and Asia and staged over 400 times till now.</p><p>A Telugu film named <em>Annamayya</em> was made on him by K. Raghavendra Rao in 1997. It starred Nagarjuna in the lead role as Annamacharya and also featured Suman as Lord Venkateshwara and Bhanupriya as Goddess Padmavathi Devi in important roles. The film became a huge blockbuster and was the highest grosser of the year in Telugu cinema.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3599526", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Social Science", "title": "Human Rights : A basic course", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Dr. Swati Chakraborty", "duration": "137", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "30", "students": "4180", "coupon_code": "9044C76D5119DA0C3D57", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3599526_26b8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/human-rights-a-basic-course/?couponCode=HR_FREE_0522", "end_day": "2022-05-12 10:58:00+00:00", "headline": "Know your rights", "description": "<p>The course is provided both in the form of part-time as well as on correspondence basis.
