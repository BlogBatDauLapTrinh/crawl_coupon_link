You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. Beside that all topics are presented on real-life examples - this help grasp knowledge faster.</p><p>One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is implementation of backend system for online store. Also you have a lot of tasks that use domain specific terminology:&nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain specific terminology and during the lessons we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you clear vision how you can apply the knowledge in real life.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who was recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from IT-Bulls company!

You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

That means knowing the majority of LSSGB content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required.

(All the Books of the Bible) That passion drew me to seriously consider his engaging presentation. The instructor challenged me to see myself through the eyes of my Lord and Savior - not the eyes of the world! I learned many valuable teachings about the Book of Philippians by taking this course. That is a credit to the instructor preparing a very detailed and organized course that is easy to follow. The course provided me the opportunity to reflect on my walk with the Lord, and my lack of commitment to thoroughly read and learn from God's written word on a daily basis. I will never find my true path (God's will for my life) if I remain a lukewarm Bible studying believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ! It is impossible for a born again Christian to seldom study the Bible, pray without ceasing or draw closer to God in a reconciled relationship while following the secular world. This course has reignited the fire that once was within me to learn from the Bible daily. I praise the Lord for Boomy Tokan who followed the Holy Spirit's prompting in preparing and sharing this course. I look forward to taking the other courses that Boomy has prepared. Thank you, Lord, for guiding me to this course, which has provided me with a much deeper spiritual understanding of the Book of Philippians.</p><p><strong>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p><p><strong>I trust you will also partake of what the SPIRIT of GOD wants to communicate to you</strong> as you embark upon this study.

It\u2019s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications.

This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1638357822&Signature=SDwXzqLrIwmojZz7Vr8F0HrqFjZZN7d8JiX9eHWxoXEZk8EJi64M0KZnc1o4vxFFQmh2yn0B56MDs6XbedcFXMYLF16qa~gDZ5scKHw1cpliv07dCy4DDEcYS56k9WOM~l336SGK31thvPlFGbeNcRq9M~i8oktO95qER4lp1blN4J97XBVwFs8jcveLica36-8T2kZuKxgTHd7W4MjxVEdcD6stVFeONRPniV9nOs5EFq2ASV4hc~xnbjqH0OdBSRj97rmRir1CVyiV-yr2-7OxZrF~4nlle7J4nn~QOkS8Bp~q4bszSDRVO7dRRtYsixo4dyI2~CHXhEWnVW1HHQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3904774", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Human Resources", "title": "Diversity At Workplace", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nevcihan Dogan", "duration": "32 mins", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "136", "students": "26898", "coupon_code": "NOV.2021", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3904774_476b.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/diversity-at-workplace-t/?couponCode=NOV.2021", "end_day": "2021-12-04 08:14:53+00:00", "headline": "If you want to position your business for success, hire a diverse workforce.", "description": "<p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> is vital for employees because it manifests itself in building a great reputation for the company, leading to increased profitability and opportunities for workers.</p><p>Workplace diversity is important within the organization as well as outside.</p><p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> means that a company\u2019s workforce includes people of varying gender, age, religion, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, languages, education, abilities, etc.</p><p><strong>Why is workplace diversity so important?</strong></p><p>In the modern, globally connected society and market, workplace diversity is becoming a <strong>necessity </strong>rather than a banner companies wave to show their commitment to embracing differences.</p><p>Most of the modern companies can sell their products <strong>all over the world</strong>, reaching many different groups of people.
