But it doesn't have to be!</p><p>TJ Walker is a teacher who has taught online for more than 20 years. In addition to conducting online <strong>teacher training</strong>, Walker has conducted online and in-person media training and public speaking workshops for Presidents, Prime Ministers, Nobel Peace Prize winners, and network news anchors. </p><p>Traditional <strong>Teacher Training</strong> has not included techniques to help teachers communicate effectively and confidently in front of a video camera.

TJ Walker will guide you through the process, step-by-step, on how to be equally confident and competent in the online classroom as you are in the real world classroom.</p><p>You will never be nervous again in front of a video camera or in front of students you can't see.</p><p>Learning to teach effectively on camera in an online environment is now an unfortunate but necessary ingredient in<strong> teacher training</strong>.

This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "754112", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_category": "General Health", "title": "Healthy living with \"No Oil\" Recipes - Non Vegetarian", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Susmita Dutta", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "79", "students": "21377", "coupon_code": "JAN2022FREE1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/754112_7441_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/no-oil-cooking-meat-recipes-no-cholesterol-fat-free-food/?couponCode=JAN2022FREE1", "end_day": "2022-01-12 22:24:32+00:00", "headline": "Better Health.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android.

In one place. In this training course.</p><p>This guarantees you that this training course <strong>will save a lot of your time.</strong></p><p>If you would start learning Selenium by yourself you would notice that on the internet there is a lot of directions to learn Selenium, a lot of different specific topics to learn, which are not applicable on most projects. So, you have to experiment with all the possible solutions to find out which one is the best for you.</p><p>In this training course, you will discover Selenium <strong>from the very beginning.</strong><br>What I suggest to you, is a training course, where step by step, with detailed homework program, with practical tasks, with a thorough review of each practical task solution we will learn Selenium together.</p><p>This program will give you enough knowledge to <strong>get your first job </strong>and be able to <strong>implement a test automation application in Selenium.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-05-16_06-51-58-c8d4895efe1e06160c7fbdf1b5205b7b/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=j4x4sGPLd_dGTbPCKLYyJg%3D%3D%2C1641648348"}, {"course_id": "3619180", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Engineering", "title": "Java Collections Framework + Generics, Lambdas & Stream API", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Andrii Piatakha", "duration": "5.5 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "253", "students": "96944", "coupon_code": "JCF_FREE_JAN", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3619180_1265_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/java-collections-framework-learnit/?couponCode=JCF_FREE_JAN", "end_day": "2022-01-12 19:53:29+00:00", "headline": "Learn Java Collections Framework from scratch to PRO level with practical exercises", "description": "<p>From this course you can learn <strong>Java Collections Framework, together with Generics, Lambda Functions, Method References and Stream API. </strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses in this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding exercises </strong></p><p>To learn programming it is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. Beside that all topics are presented on real-life examples - this help grasp knowledge faster.</p><p>One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is implementation of backend system for online store. Also you have a lot of tasks that use domain specific terminology:&nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain specific terminology and during the lessons we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you clear vision how you can apply the knowledge in real life.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement.

Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android.

However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4364456", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Cryptocurrency & Blockchain", "title": "How To Get Started Buying and Selling NFTs Without Gas Fees", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Mike Holp", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "22", "students": "2113", "coupon_code": "FREENFT2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4364456_ebf2_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/opensea-nft-tutorial/?couponCode=FREENFT2022", "end_day": "2022-01-11 11:04:51+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to get started buying and selling NFTs on the largest marketplace in less than 60 minutes", "description": "<p>This course will show the exact step-by-step no nonsense process to successfully create and sell your first NFT&nbsp;(non-fungible token) on OpenSea.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who was recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from IT-Bulls company!
