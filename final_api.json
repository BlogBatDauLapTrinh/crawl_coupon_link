So, let's get started.<br></p><p>In this course, we're going to talk about the introduction (what's the need for this IEEE-1584 standard). We're going to talk about the history and go over the IEEE 1584-2002 version up to the 2018 version. And there are the 16 years of rich history that's extremely important to understand where we are today with the 2018 version and some of the changes.<br><br>Furthermore, we're going to talk about a lot of different changes in the IEEE-1584 2018 standard. There are different busbar electrode combinations, there's a different voltage range and conductor gap information, there's information about the box, the height, the width, and the depth, and how they use that enclosure box to calculate the instant energy levels. There's the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we'll talk about that as well. Grounded versus ungrounded systems, the two-second rule cut off where that is, and as well as what's next? what goes above and beyond this 2018 standard?<br><br>So, stick around you'll expect to learn a lot from this standard and from this course.

We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Introduction to Machine Learning</strong></p><p>In this section we will learn - What does Machine Learning mean. What are the meanings or different terms associated with machine learning? You will see some examples so that you understand what machine learning actually is. It also contains steps involved in building a machine learning model, not just linear models, any machine learning model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Data Preprocessing</strong></p><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation and correlation.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 5 - Regression Model</strong></p><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it,&nbsp; it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in Python will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-</p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Hindi"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4225092", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Facebook Ads B2B: Facebook Advertising+ Facebook Ads for B2B", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Dekker Fraser, MBA", "duration": "246", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "171", "students": "27136", "coupon_code": "SECOND", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4225092_54ed_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-ads-b2b/?couponCode=1E6F1458F794CBD8D5E6", "end_day": "2022-05-15 06:41:00+00:00", "headline": "Groundbreaking B2B Facebook Advertising for Generating Leads & Customers | B2B Facebook Ads + Facebook Marketing", "description": "<p>This is the ultimate course on business-to-business<strong> Facebook advertising</strong> and Facebook marketing!</p><p>I\u2019ve been advertising on Facebook for over a decade.

But here\u2019s something you may not have known.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>________________________________________________________________________</em></strong></p><p><em>Why is this weight loss program different from others and Why should I believe it will work?</em></p><p>I must admit that there are 1000\u2019s of weight loss programs and ideas on how to shed those unwanted fatty parts of the body. Some of which will be good and many are just plain harmful. One of the reasons why my weight loss program is ideal for most people is that it leans heavily on using the natural body movements with long-term approaches to achieve results. It does not promise you a 1-week result without any effort. But it is perfect for those who have not done much for so many years and want to start. Plus those who have gone through the yo-yo periods of dieting and weight loss programs will also find it useful.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p><em>What is the proof that it has worked?</em> </p><p>Everything I have spoken to people who have lost weight and continue to maintain their weight I have been fascinated by how they all seem to enjoy the process, look great and confident they can continue. Whenever I have asked how they have arrived at their ideal weight and attitude the response has always been the same; it take long term consistent effort. Here lies one of the big secrets. We used to think some were either born to look trim whiles other were born to be overweight but the truth is that anyone can change the way they look by consistent, action towards a goal. Sooner or later you will get there. Hence, the program detailed in the course is to help you achieve the weight they want by starting with a small habit that will propel you towards the destination you want! That is what has helped me to lose weight nad continue to help me.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p><strong> So what is required:</strong> </p><p>It doesn\u2019t require you to be very fit when you start because the program is tailored to help you wherever you are starting from.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t require to know the right techniques. I will be giving you all you need to know to get you started. The rest can be learned as you go on,</p><p>It doesn\u2019t require \u201cluck.\u201d But taking small steps that will help you enter in new habit that ensure you enjoy the process</p><p>It doesn\u2019t require \u201ctalent.\u201d Just the determination to change and be better</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p><strong>In this course we will cover:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The proof that my program works</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Reasons you should exercise</p></li><li><p>The Role of food and water</p></li><li><p>How affirmation will help you</p></li><li><p>Why going the gym did not work for me</p></li><li><p>Why dieting can be harmful</p></li><li><p>Biggest exercise mistakes</p></li><li><p>My 12 Months Exercise Program</p></li><li><p>Resources / Updates / Reviews</p></li></ul><p>Remember I Am Here To Help You!</p><p>========================================================================</p><p><strong><em>Important information before you enroll:</em></strong><br></p><ul><li><p>You are covered by<strong> a 30-day money back guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!</strong></p></li><li><p>You also have <strong>unlimited, lifetime access to the course!</strong></p></li><li><p>You will enjoy<strong> free access to any updates I will provide</strong></p></li><li><p>You are free to<strong> ask any questions and will get a reply as soon as possible</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</strong></p><p><strong>So what are you waiting for?</strong></p><p><strong>Every delay is a barrier stopping you from feeling good and looking great.

Start your Android App Development carrer now and be Pro !", "description": "<p><strong><em>*Get the Official Certificate after Completing the Course</em></strong></p><p>Even though Kotlin is a full-fledged functional programming language, it preserves most of the object-oriented nature of Java as an alternative programming style, which is very handy when converting existing Java code. Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does <em>not</em> have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.</p><p>Kotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is <em>not</em> the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().</p><p>Kotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable <em>unless</em> marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.</p><p>Then, you'll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You'll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you'll delve into Android's RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You'll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you'll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You'll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. <em>The core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming</em>. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you'll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.</p><p>Are you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven't found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don't know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you're just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you</p><p>When Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..</p><p><br></p><p>Kotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, <em>which is great for beginners</em>. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes.

It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.</p><p>&nbsp; It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula 150 millions people speak Arabic&nbsp; to learn its vocabularies you should listen to Arabic speakers in every field listen before speak the Arabic grammar&nbsp; &nbsp;is very important to know the structure of the sentence s </p><p>how can I speak like native&nbsp; listen to drama listen to old songs listen to sport listen to cartoon video clips&nbsp; &nbsp;all in Arabic try to repeat the words and phrases</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4626656", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Practice Exam", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Netwo Tech", "duration": "0", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "1924", "coupon_code": "SECOND", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4626656_fd8c.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-practice-exam-l/?couponCode=FREEMAY2022", "end_day": "2022-05-11 11:10:00+00:00", "headline": "Pass AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Certification Exam in One go.", "description": "<p>If you are preparing for AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate certification exam and looking for best resources then these practice tests are just for you.

It powers search engines, VR applications, air travel, movie production, and even exploration on Mars! In fact, C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages there is.</p><p>What makes C++ unique?</p><p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language, created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979. Over the decades, C++ has become the language of choice for certain kinds of applications.</p><p>C++ is most popularly used for building large software infrastructure and applications that run on limited resources. Because C++ can directly manipulate the hardware (or machine) that it runs on, programmers can fine-tune their code to run efficiently in any environment, even when there\u2019s limited hardware space or energy available to power the application. This translates to applications that run quickly and reliably on a variety of devices, making C++ ideal for forming the base layer of many important applications.</p><p>For these reasons, C++ is an excellent choice for building software that is fast, efficient at managing system resources, and reliable in performing critical tasks.</p><p>What is C++ used for?</p><p>C++ can be found in a wide variety of industries. Check out the following list for some of the most notable, interesting, and even surprising real-world applications of C++.</p><p>Operating systems</p><p>C++ plays an important part in well-known operating systems, from MacOS and Windows to mobile operating systems like iOS. In general, operating systems need to be fast and efficient at managing system resources. With the low-level (close to machine code) capabilities of C++, developers can structure their code to make even the smallest details of an operating system fast and energy efficient.</p><p>Game development</p><p>C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages in game development. It has been used to create: games, such as World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, and StarCraft, game engines like Unreal Engine, and gaming consoles, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>Gaming involves lots of resource-intensive functions, whether it\u2019s generating graphics or facilitating multiplayer sessions. C++ helps in optimizing the use of resources, such as allowing programmers to adjust exactly how data structures and memory allocation are handled.</p><p>IoT devices</p><p>IoT (Internet of Things) devices include embedded systems that often rely on C++. Some examples of these devices are appliances, cars, smartwatches, TVs, and medical devices. Because the hardware is often embedded inside of an object, these devices have to operate with limited computing resources and strict power requirements. C++ helps programmers control how these resources are used in order to run programs more efficiently.</p><p>Databases</p><p>C++ is used to build popular database tools like MySQL and MongoDB. These databases form the backbone of many well-known applications, including ones created by Google, Netflix, YouTube, Adobe, and more. C++ is ideal for helping structure databases to support efficient storage.</p><p>Web browsers</p><p>C++ plays a role in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera. It is used to develop back-end services that retrieve information from databases and render code into interactive web pages. C++ helps web browsers carry out these tasks with speed and minimal delays, which means we don\u2019t have to wait long for content to appear on our screens.</p><p>Machine learning tools</p><p>Machine learning tools, such as TensorFlow, rely on C++ as a back-end programming language. Even though data scientists can use TensorFlow with Python, for example, the core machine learning calculations are carried out with C++ code. In fact, C++ has a large collection of libraries that power these highly-sophisticated calculations that train machine learning models.</p><p>AR/VR applications</p><p>C++ is widely used for developing augmented reality and virtual reality applications. In fact, many of these applications run on Unreal Engine, which is built using C++. AR/VR applications need to handle large amounts of data that adjust continuously based on input from camera sensors and user interactions. C++ is ideal for helping process all of this data while creating seamless virtual experiences.</p><p>Scientific research</p><p>C++ plays a notable role in scientific research, from space exploration to high-energy particle physics. At CERN, scientists use C++ for analyzing data on subatomic particles that can help answer questions about how our universe originated. At NASA, C++ has been used to build autonomous driving systems that help the Mars Rovers navigate unknown terrain. Many parts of the International Space Station are built using C++ as well.</p><p>Financial tools</p><p>Many banks and financial institutions use C++ to build their software infrastructure, which powers applications for banking, trading, and financial modeling. The speed and reliable performance of C++ is ideal for processing millions of daily transactions, facilitating a high volume and frequency of trades, and creating data simulations for large portfolios.</p><p>Flight software</p><p>C++ is a commonly-used language for flight software that powers commercial airplanes and military and defense aircraft (such as the F-16 and F-35 planes). C++ is used to build a lot of the safety-critical software, which is required to follow strict coding standards to make sure that the wings, engines, and other critical parts work predictably during each flight.</p><p>Google search engine</p><p>Google\u2019s search engine relies on C++ to make sure that search results show up quickly and with minimal response time. C++ also powers the machine learning and other complex algorithms that make sure we get the best possible results for our search. Google\u2019s crawling and indexing infrastructure is also implemented in C++.</p><p>Medical technology</p><p>C++ can be found in a variety of medical applications, from MRI machines to lab testing equipment to systems that handle patient information. C++ is also used to model data and run data simulations for bioinformatics research, because many advanced algorithms written for the medical and biological sciences are implemented in C++.</p><p>Telecommunications</p><p>C++ is widely used in building telephone, Internet, and other telecommunications infrastructure. It\u2019s ideal for managing resources to handle tons of simultaneous communication with speed and efficiency.</p><p>Movie production</p><p>Many of the graphics and special effects that you see in movies are created with C++. C++ is great for this role because it can handle large files with high-quality footage and run many of the advanced calculations that make the special effects possible.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2468316", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Real Estate", "title": "Facebook Ads Copywriting & Facebook Ads for Real Estate 2022", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ing.

For example, the ignition system was only responsible for supplying the voltage needed to fire the spark plugs. Ignition timing was controlled by vacuum and mechanical advance systems. Today there are very few electrical systems that are still independent. Today, most manufacturers network their electrical systems together through computers. This means that information gathered by one system can be used by another. The result may be that a faulty component may cause several symptoms. Consider the following example. The wiper system can interact with the headlight system to turn on the headlights whenever the wipers are turned on. The wipers can interact with the vehicle speed sensor to provide for speed-sensitive wiper operation. The speed sensor may provide information to the antilock brake module. The antilock brake module can then share this information with the transmission control module, and the instrument cluster can receive vehicle speed information to operate the speedometer. If the vehicle speed sensor should fail, this could result in antilock brake operation and a warning light turned on in the dash. But it could also result in the speedometer not functioning, the transmission not shifting, and the wipers not operating properly.</p><p>The computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data and are capable of operating other devices. The use of computers on automobiles has expanded to include control and operation of several functions, including climate control, lighting circuits, cruise control, antilock braking, electronic suspension systems, and electronic shift transmissions. Some of these are functions of what is known as a body control module (BCM). Some body computer-controlled systems include direction lights, rear window defogger, illuminated entry, intermittent wipers, and other systems that were once thought of as basic. A computer processes the physical conditions that represent information (data). The operation of the computer is divided into four basic functions:</p><p>1. Input.</p><p>2. Processing.</p><p>3. Storage.</p><p>4. Output.</p><p>Vehicle Communication NetworksMost manufacturers now use a system of vehicle communications called multiplexing(MUX) to allow control modules to share information. Multiplexing provides the ability to use a single circuit to distribute and share data between several control modules throughout the vehicle. Because the data is transmitted through a single circuit, bulky wiring harnesses are eliminated. Vehicle manufacturers will use multiplexing systems to enable different control modules to share information. A MUX wiring system uses bus data links that connect each module. The term bus refers to the transporting of data from one module to another. Each module can transmit and receive digital codes over the bus data links. The signal sent from a sensor can go to any one of the modules and can be shared by the other modules. Electronic Accessory systems with the growing use of computers, most systems can be controlled electronically. This provides for improved monitoring of the systems for proper operation and the ability to detect if a fault occurs. Electronic Cruise Control Systems. Cruise control is a system that allows the vehicle to maintain a preset speed with the driver\u2019s foot off of the accelerator. Most cruise control systems are a combination of electrical and mechanical components. Memory Seats. The memory seat feature allows the driver to program different seat positions that can be recalled at the push of a button. The memory seat feature is an addition to the basic power seat system. Most memory seat systems share the same basic operating principles, the difference being in programming methods and the number of positions that can be programmed. Most systems provide for two-seat positions to be stored in memory. An easy exit feature may be an additional function of the memory seat that provides for easier entrance and exit of the vehicle by moving the seat all the way back and down. Some systems also move the steering wheel up and to full retract. Electronic Sunroofs. Some manufacturers have introduced electronic control of their electric sunroofs.

You will learn how to setup retargeting and Google shopping (google merchant centre). You will also learn how to create Google ads performance reports with Google data studio. All screen recordings show new Google ads manager layout.</p><p><strong>Setup your Google search campaign today</strong></p><p>Google Ads are a great way to boost your brand profile, generate more leads and traffic, and gain more sales. The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign.</p><p>With this Google Ads course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you'll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed. The strength of advertising with Google lies in its massive market reach and the ability it gives you to create highly targeted campaigns. With Google Ads you can drive quality traffic to your brand, garnered from people searching Google for products and services, similar to the ones you're offering.</p><p>To boost your reach, ads from Google often feature across other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, and the Google Display Network. Another great feature of Google Ads is the Google Ads Analytics dashboard, which allows you to monitor the performance of your ads over time. This helps you hone the effectiveness of your Google Ads and adjust your content and target audience for a more optimal return on your investment. It's definitely worth investing in Google Ads, as even if you're ranking well organically, your results are likely to appear lower than those who have paid to promote. </p><p><strong>Write Google ads copy that people love to click on</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use copywriting strategies that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of Ad Copies are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make Ad Copies sound more specific.</p><p><strong>Choose the right keywords</strong></p><p>Search for words or phrases related to your products or services. The keywords you choose are used to show your ads to people. Select high-quality, relevant keywords for your ad campaign to help you reach only the most interested people, who are more likely to become your customers.</p><p><strong>Optimise your Google ads targeting</strong></p><p>Targeting ads is an essential part of a successful advertising campaign. You may have designed the perfect ad, but you'll need to show it to the right people at the right time to better reach your goal. Google Ads offers different ways of targeting your ads.</p><p><strong>Learn new keyword matching options</strong></p><p>Keywords are words or phrases that are used to match ads with the terms people are searching for. The keyword match types dictate how closely the keyword needs to match with the user\u2019s search query in order for the ad to be considered for the auction. So you could use broad match to serve your ad on a wider variety of user searches or you could use exact match to hone in on specific user searches.</p><p><strong>Use efficiently negative keywords</strong></p><p>Negative keywords let you exclude search terms from your campaigns and help you focus on only the keywords that matter to your customers. Better targeting can put your ad in front of interested users and increase your return on investment (ROI).</p><p><strong>Understand everything about new search terms reports</strong></p><p>Use the search terms report to identify new search terms with high potential, and add them to your keyword list. Look for search terms that aren't as relevant to your business, and add them as negative keywords. This can help you avoid spending money showing your ad to people who aren't interested in it.</p><p><strong>Use auction insights to compare performance</strong></p><p>The auction insights report lets you compare your performance with other advertisers who are participating in the same auctions that you are. This information can help you make strategic decisions about bidding and budgeting by showing you where you're succeeding and where you may be missing opportunities for improved performance. The auction insights report is available for both Search and Shopping campaigns.</p><p><strong>Determine a bid strategy based on your goals</strong></p><p>Google Ads offers several bid strategies that are tailored to different types of campaigns. Depending on which networks your campaign is targeting, and whether you want to focus on getting clicks, impressions, conversions, or views you can determine which strategy is best for you. In this article, we'll describe how to use your advertising goals to choose your bid strategy.</p><p><strong>Improve your Google PPC quality score</strong></p><p>Google uses your PPC Quality Score (QS) to decide how your ad should rank. The higher your quality score, the better your position will be. This score factors in how relevant your landing page and ads are to the keywords you've selected and also assesses your expected clickthrough rate.</p><p><strong>Make use of ad extensions</strong></p><p>Ad Extensions let you supplement your Google ad with one of five additional features for no extra cost. You can select from a Sitelink, Call button, Location info, or App download link, or can choose to showcase an Offer instead.</p><p><strong>Learn Google ads retargeting</strong></p><p>Retargeting is a way to connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app. It allows you to strategically position your ads in front of these audiences as they browse Google or its partner websites, thus helping you increase your brand awareness or remind those audiences to make a purchase.</p><p><strong>Set up Google shopping (Google merchant centre)</strong></p><p>If you're a retailer, you can use Shopping campaigns to promote your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better qualified leads. To get started, you'll send us your product data with Merchant Center and create a campaign in Google Ads. Then, we'll use your campaign to create ads on Google and around the web where potential customers can see what you're selling. We call these placements Shopping ads because they appear in a different, more visual format. In contrast to a text ad, which displays text only, Shopping ads show users a photo of your product, plus a title, price, store name, and more. These ads give users a strong sense of the product you're selling before they click the ad, which gives you more qualified leads.</p><p><strong>Create visual performance reports with Google data studio</strong></p><p>You can add Ad Manager as a data source in Data Studio to create data visualisation reports. The most popular Ad Manager report dimensions and metrics are available. These reports can be securely shared with others in your organisation or publicly.</p><p><strong>Learn how to efficiently setup YouTube ads</strong></p><p>YouTube connects you to the people who matter most to your business. Turn viewers into customers, on any budget. YouTube Ads uses Google data to match your message to the right people at the right moment. YouTube Ads make it easy for people to choose your business. Get more purchases, subscribers, website visits, and more. Anyone can make a YouTube ad that gets results. </p><p><strong>Learn how to quickly import &amp; setup Bing ads from your Google ads account</strong></p><p>Create deeper customer relationships with Microsoft Advertising.

One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome. Hence, it provides the most information about very small differences between two viruses that would look the same using other diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>Viral replication</strong> is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.&nbsp; Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.</p><p>Through the generation of abundant copies of its genome and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts. Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells.

These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using integrase. Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases </p><p><strong>class 7: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate </strong>This small group of viruses, exemplified by the Hepatitis B virus, have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle&nbsp; (ccc DNA) that serves as a template for production of viral mRNAs and a sub genomic RNA. The progenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase and for production of the DNA genome.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2925610", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Sell Products with Facebook Ads Fast On Shopify 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yasir Ahmed, M.B.A", "duration": "82", "rating": "3.1", "reviews": "66", "students": "26205", "coupon_code": "SECOND", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2925610_f8b9_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/shopify-dropshipping-facebook-ads-ecommerce-masterclass-2020-2021-2022/?couponCode=A952022", "end_day": "2022-05-14 19:42:00+00:00", "headline": "Built a brand Shopify store for eCommerce using secret Facebook marketing targeting strategy for ecom & dropshipping", "description": "<p>Learn how to <strong>create a Shopify dropshipping website for eCommerce along with a secret Facebook advertising strategy</strong> to bring in sales from anywhere in the world without any experience. </p><p>This course teaches you:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Making Shopify Brand Store</p></li><li><p>Find Marketing Content Free For Ads</p></li><li><p>Running perfect Facebook ads to get sales </p></li><li><p>It requires no experience.</p></li></ul><p>This is a very practical course that covers all the basics you need to get started and start selling online in no time</p><p><strong>Don't waste your time and money on useless youtube videos that get you nowhere, enroll now and start selling today!</strong></p><p>regards, </p><p>Yasir Ahmed, MBA</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About ME:</strong></p><p>Use paid advertising to grow your business under my mentorship.

Berdasarkan data dari badan kesehatan dunia, hampir sebanyak 3/4 dari seluruh angka kematian di Indonesia pada tahun 2016 diakibatkan oleh penyakit tidak menular seperti penyakit jantung, dibetes mellitus tipe 2, stroke dan kanker. Hal ini menunjukan besarnya masalah yang harus ditangani oleh tenaga kesehatan, salah satunya adalah ahli gizi. Gizi memegang peranan penting dalam proses pencegahan dan penanganan dari penyakit-penyakit tidak menular tersebut. Hal ini kemudian menuntut ahli gizi untuk memiliki pemahaman yang mendalam mengenai penyakit sehingga dapat membantu mencari strategi pemecahan masalah yang berhubungan dengan penyakit ini.</p><p>Berkembangnya ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi memungkinkan proses pencegahan dapat dilakukan sedini mungkin bahkan ketika gejala-gejala awal penyakit tersebut belum muncul. Dengan bantuan teknologi di bidang genetik, kini petugas kesehatan mampu memprediksi risiko penyakit dengan lebih presisi melalui pemanfatan data variasi genetik seseorang. Sebagai tambahan, kini metode skrining banyak dikembangkan untuk melihat biomarker atau penanda awal munculnya penyakit dengan melihat profil transkripsional, protein, maupun metabolit yang berhubungan dengan patogenesis penyakit. Keseluruhan perkembangan teknologi biologi molekuler akan mempermudah tenaga kesehatan untuk melalukan penganan pasien dengan lebih baik. Teknologi ini kini telah hadir di Indonesia.

Di awal tahun 2000an, peneliti di seluruh dunia melakukan kolaborasi untuk mengkode gen-gen yang ada di dalam tubuh manusia. Proyek ini disebut sebagai human genome project. Dengan adanya <em>human genome project</em>, kini kita dapat memetakan gen yang terdapat dalam tubuh manusia lalu melakukan evaluasi mengenai fungsinya bagi tubuh.</p><p>Bidang gizi molekuler mempelajari 2 aspek dari interaksi antara faktor gen dan faktor gizi terhadap luaran yaitu status kesehatan manusia. Aspek pertama adalah bidang ini mengkaji bagaimana zat gizi yang dikonsumsi manusia dapat memengaruhi gen yang dimiliki oleh tubuh. Gizi diketahui memiliki peran spesifik dalam tubuh manusia, dan peran tersebut diperantarai oleh peristiwa molekuler. Bidang ini disebut sebagai bidang nutrigenomik. Aspek kedua dari bidang gizi molekuler adalah bidang yang mengkaji pengaruh faktor genetik terhadap interaksi antara gizi dan status kesehatan seseorang. Teori ini didasarkan pada fakta bahwa respon seseorang terhadap diet bisa bervariasi tergantung variasi dari faktor genetik yang dimiliki seseorang. Bidang ini kemudian disebut sebagai bidang nutrigenetik.

Although some records suggest that chickens were raised around 3200 BC, archaeological evidence only goes back to about 2000 BC. It is considered that chickens originate from India, and that the red jungle fowl is an ancestor to today\u2019s modern chicken. The breeding of chickens in captivity dates back to at least 1400 BC in Egypt. But intensive poultry production only&nbsp; before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,&nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.&nbsp; &nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It is the advent of vaccination for conditions such as Marek\u2019s disease, in addition to preproducing good quality day-old chicks starts with the breeder flock. Not only is the quality of the egg important, but also the health and nutritional status of the breeders are having an impact on day-old markable improvements in nutrition, genetics, and management, that has allowed the poultry industry to quickly develop since the late 1960s&nbsp; &nbsp; In general we can divide the factors associated with chick quality in two categories: EGG RELATED FACTORS

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \"stone\" in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles' successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.</p><p> LEARN Harmful Effects of Fungi: </p><p>1. Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp;

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the R environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in R</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture in R where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.

So, if you want to create an unforgettable first impression, it is very important that you prepare yourself with the correct tools and techniques before you even go to meet the person in question whom you want to impress or go to the event/interview.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked this one question to the many decision-makers all over the world \"If you would like to see the change that will make your organization more productive, what would it be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody came back with one word and they said ATTITUDE. If people had a better disposition, they would have better team coordination, quality would go up, the bottom line would go up, and obviously, success is bound to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that 85% of the time a person gets a job or a promotion is because of the disposition? ONLY 15% depends on how intelligent they are or how many facts and figures they know.</p><p><br></p><p>And almost 100% of the education dollars go to teaching facts and figures which accounts for only 15% of the success, and what we are talking about in this course is 85%. This is what brings us to a point that it is not our position but our disposition that determines our success.</p><p>Now, once you are standing in front of the person you want to impress, you want to make sure that you connect with them on a personal as well as a professional level. Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is through the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.
