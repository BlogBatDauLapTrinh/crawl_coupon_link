Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.</p><p>Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps <em>the</em> oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.</p><p>Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.</p><p><br></p><p>Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.</p><p>Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialized, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"Universalists\" such as Einstein (1879\u20131955) and Lev Landau (1908\u20131968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1139400", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "How to Install a Free SSL Certificate using Let's Encrypt", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "duration": "59", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "884", "students": "113997", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1139400_c79c_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/fix-googles-new-not-secure-warning-with-lets-encrypt/?couponCode=YOUACCEL25889", "end_day": "2022-04-26 02:10:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn to Secure website traffic using HTTPS by installing a FREE Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate!", "description": "<p><strong>In the modern internet age, delivering web content over a secure protocol has become essential.</strong>\u00a0<br><br>Since January 2017, Google\u00a0attaches a warning label to any website that does not secure sensitive web page content by delivering it using HTTPS.

The MAT is an admissions exam accepted by many graduate programs in the United States. Additionally, it is used by many high-IQ societies all over the world as an admission requirement. The MAT goal is to assess logical and analytical reasoning through completion of partial analogies. The test duration is 1 hour and contains 120 questions. Exam formats include both <strong>Computer-Based Tests (CBT)</strong> and paper and pencil format.</p><p>This free practice exam features realistic questions that will help you not only review key vocabulary, but also familiarize yourself with the MAT\u2019s 120 Analogy exam format. This exam is also very good preparation for those preparing for the GRE Test, as both exams cover analogies.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>The MAT is a one hundred item, fifty minute verbal analogies test. All of the questions will be in the form of A:B:C:D. The analogies are written so that A is to B as C is to D. However, your job will be to fill in the missing term by correctly identifying the relationship that exists.</p><p><strong>Test Centers, Dates, and Fees</strong></p><p>Currently, there are more than six hundred testing centers in fifty states as well as in several foreign countries. If you live more than one hundred miles away from a designated test center, special accommodations can be made. Dates will vary by testing site, so be sure to consult with the test site. The average fee to take the MAT is about $50, though that varies by region.</p><p><strong>Scores</strong></p><p>When you register to take the MAT, you are asked to provide up to three addresses that you wish to have your score reports sent. Sending your test scores to three schools is included in the test administration fee. However, it is your responsibility to provide accurate addresses for the schools.</p><p><strong>History of the MAT</strong></p><p>According to the Miller Analogies Test Manual (1970) the test was developed to measure scholastic aptitude at the graduate school level. It is also developed to measure how well the test taker can recognize relationships between words.</p><p>Vocabulary plays a very important role on this test. Before you can correctly identify the relationship that exists between the words, you must be able to recognize and comprehend the meaning of the answer choices. Often, it is not reasoning that makes test items difficult. Rather, it is in recognizing the answer choices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Smarter not harder</em></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3905344", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Testing", "title": "Selenium in C# - Setup Simple Test Automation Framework", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Tigran Ter-Karapetyants", "duration": "227", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "215", "students": "59671", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3905344_d222_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-in-c-sharp-taf-for-beginners-learnit/?couponCode=F4ADEAFB81F249955677", "end_day": "2022-04-25 18:19:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Selenium from scratch and build Test Automation framework with minimum set of tools: C#, NuGet, NUnit, Selenium", "description": "<p>Some of you may ask a question like: \u201c<em>Why should I select this course, instead of learning Selenium by myself?</em>\u201d</p><p>So, what is extremely cool about this course?</p><p>You <strong>won\u2019t learn just theory</strong>.</p><p>You will have practical technical tasks to <strong>implement real test applications.</strong></p><p>You <strong>won\u2019t need to search</strong> for answers to your questions <strong>on Google</strong>, because you can't understand lessons or homework.</p><p>Everything is in here.

Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions.

The strength of PMI\u2019s certifications is that they are portable and not tied to any single method, standard or organization. PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3891376", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Testing", "title": "Selenium in Java - Setup Simple Test Automation Framework", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Tigran Ter-Karapetyants", "duration": "231", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "409", "students": "80808", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3891376_1906_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-in-java-taf-for-beginners-learnit/?couponCode=10DF1FE7C24B65A34CDE", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:45:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Selenium from scratch and build Test Automation framework with minimum set of tools: Java, Gradle, JUnit, Selenium", "description": "<p>Some of you may ask a question like: \u201c<em>Why should I select this course, instead of learning Selenium by myself?</em>\u201d</p><p>So, what is extremely cool about this course?</p><p>You <strong>won\u2019t learn just theory</strong>.</p><p>You will have practical technical tasks to <strong>implement real test applications.</strong></p><p>You <strong>won\u2019t need to search</strong> for answers to your questions <strong>on Google</strong>, because you can't understand lessons or homework.</p><p>Everything is in here.

Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called <em>edges</em>. Neurons and edges typically have a <em>weight</em> that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.</p><p><strong>Deep learning</strong> (also known as <strong>deep structured learning</strong>) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p><p>Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.</p><p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue.</p><p>The adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the \"structured\" part.</p><p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to <strong>natural intelligence</strong> displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.</p><p>Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.</p><p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p><p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2582676", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Development Tools", "title": "Google Chrome Basics", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "31", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "160", "students": "25885", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2582676_bceb_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-google-chrome/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42205", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:40:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Google Chrome Basics", "description": "<p><strong>SO, YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR A COURSE THAT WILL TEACH YOU GOOGLE CHROME QUICKLY &amp; IN A FUN MANNER?</strong></p><p>I\u2019ve got just the course for you!</p><p>Welcome, my name is Josh Werner with Learn Tech Plus and I\u2019ve put this course together to help people just like you quickly master Google Chrome...Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a web developer with existing programming knowledge/skills!</p><p>If your goal is to become a web developer, then this course is perfect for you.

The test has just been updated for February 2021. This is the first test in a series that covers the knowledge and skills of basic nursing you\u2019ll need as a new certified nursing assistant (CNA). The questions are based on the same categories that are included in the official exam. The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint. If you still make a mistake, you\u2019ll see the correct response displayed along with an explanation to help you understand. If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator. The skills test portion is about 35-45 minutes and covers five or more skills.</p><p><strong>Alternate names:</strong></p><p>A CNA test is also known as:</p><ul><li><p>Certified Nursing Assistant examination</p></li><li><p>Nursing assistant test</p></li><li><p>CNA knowledge test</p></li><li><p>CNA exam</p></li><li><p>Nurse assistant test</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why CNAs are important</strong></p><p>Certified Nursing Assistants are vital members of the health care team. Your skills can keep your patients safe and comfortable. Your ability to provide hands-on care means that you may be the first to notice changes in your patients. You have a lot to learn, but we are here to help. Start with the basic skills. Nearly everything builds from there. As you learn, you will become a valuable team member. Remember that health care would not be possible without the CNA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CNA \u2013 A Certified Nursing Assistant</strong> is a nurse that helps patients with healthcare needs under the supervision of a <strong>Registered Nurse</strong> (RN) or a <strong>Licensed Practical Nurse</strong> (LPN). Also known as a <strong>Nursing Assistant</strong> (NA) a <strong>Patient Care Assistant</strong> (PCA) or a <strong>State Tested Nurse Aid</strong> (STNA), the individual who carries this title needs a strong work ethic and ability, but issues of liability and legality prevent CNA\u2019s from performing certain procedures.</p><p>We have the Best Free <strong>CNA Practice Test Online</strong>.<br>These are full-length practice exams with challenging questions.

Using sample questions to study for your test is the most effective study practice you can use. The advantages of using RMA sample tests include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increasing Your Speed</strong> \u2013 The RMA exam has a three hour time limit. Although most students who take the RMA feel that there is sufficient time, taking the practice tests with self-imposed timers help you budget your time effectively. You should budget approximately 1 minute for each question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Becoming comfortable with the Test Format</strong> \u2013 Every standardized test has its own unique format. As you take practice RMA tests you will become comfortable with the format of the actual test. Once the test day arrives you will have no surprises!</p></li><li><p><strong>Concentrating Your Prep Time</strong> \u2013 As you take more and more sample quizzes you begin to get a feel for the topics that you know well and the areas that you are weak on. Many students waste a lot of valuable study time by reviewing material that they are good at (often because it is easier or makes them feel better). The most effective way to study is to concentrate on the areas that you need help on.</p></li></ul><p>RMA EXAM OVERVIEW</p><p>The RMA certification exam consists of 200-210 questions that count towards your score. All of the questions will be multiple choice questions with four answer options.</p><p>Candidates are given a total of three hours to complete the test.

Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basic try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Next few sections will cover help you with interviews and Vivas.</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p><strong>What's special about this course?</strong></p><p>The course is created on the basis of three pillars of learning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Know (Study)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Do (Practice)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Review (Self feedback)</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong><em>Know</em></strong></p><p>We have created a set of concise and comprehensive videos to teach you all the SQL related skills you will need in your professional career.</p><p><strong>Do</strong></p><p>We also provide <strong>Exercises</strong> to complement the learning from the lecture video. These exercises are carefully designed to further clarify the concepts and help you with implementing the concepts on practical problems faced on-the-job.</p><p><strong>Review</strong></p><p>Check if you have learnt the concepts by executing your code and analyzing the result set. Ask questions in the discussion board if you face any difficulty.</p><p><strong>Bonus Lectures</strong></p><p>Apart from this, their is a bonus section which covers important topics from the view of job interviews and Vivas.</p><p>The Authors of this course have several years of corporate experience and hence have curated the course material keeping in mind the requirement of SQL in today's corporate world.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2362220", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Relevant Costs - Managerial Accounting Decisions & Scenarios", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "389", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "159", "students": "45043", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2362220_9ee5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/relevant-costs-managerial-accounting-decisions-scenarios/?couponCode=C6E043D174067B3BEC43", "end_day": "2022-04-24 06:32:00+00:00", "headline": "Common managerial accounting decisions analyzed using relevant cost methods that can apply to all large decisions", "description": "<p><strong>Apply relevant cost methods to common managerial decisions.</strong></p><p><strong>Managers often need to make decisions that are not routine, not part of the normal day to day process, and that can have a long-term effect on the organization. Individuals often need to make similar decisions and can apply similar tools when making decisions of a large dollar amount that can affect multiple years.</strong></p><p><strong>Although the specifics of each decision differ, the concept of relevant costs helps us put together a process for gathering and analyzing data, picking up the information that matters, and removing all the excess data that does not matter to our decision. Understanding relevant costs will reduce the likelihood of making incorrect decisions based on a sunk cost effect or not taking into account opportunity costs.</strong></p><p><strong>We will analyze the decision-making process of buying a new piece of equipment or keeping an older piece of equipment, a question often relevant to individuals as well as businesses. The decision of whether to buy new equipment is subject to the sunk fallacy effect, and we will discuss why this is.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will investigate the managerial accounting question of a \u201cspecial offer.\u201d The \u201cspecial offer\u201d question often takes the form of a one time offer to purchase from us at a reduced price. It is often the case that a business will benefit from accepting a special offer and the concept of relevant costs will help us to see why. For example, a hotel may have an incentive to take a \u201cspecial offer\u201d to sleep in a room for a night at a price far below the standard rate and even below cost as it is generally calculated. We will discuss why, and how this concept applies to business in general.</strong></p><p><strong>We will apply the concepts of relevant costs to a \u201cmake or buy\u201d type decision. Should we make a component internally or purchases it from an outside vendor?</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss the managerial accounting question of whether we should process a product further. In other words, should we sell a product at one point of production or should we process the product further and sell it for a higher price? We will also discuss a similar question related to defective inventory and whether we should scrap the inventory now or rework it.</strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss the question of what sales mix to use. In other words, if we have multiple products which ones should we produce and how much should we produce?</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss the question of eliminating a segment or department of a company. For example, if a departmental income statement shows a loss, should the department be eliminated and how can we apply relevant costs to make the best decision?</strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss

Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Endorsements on your <strong>Commercial Driver\u2019s License</strong> open you up to many more Truck Job Opportunities. However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1701240", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Financial Accounting-Depreciation Calculation & Fixed Assets", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "716", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "248", "students": "38553", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1701240_2f80.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/financial-accounting-depreciation-calculation-fixed-assets/?couponCode=805EF1A5D8E79BD676C6", "end_day": "2022-04-24 06:44:00+00:00", "headline": "Depreciation calculation, straight line method, double declining method, units of production method and disposal assets", "description": "<p><strong>Property plant and equipment, also known as plant assets, fixed assets, or depreciable assets is what we will cover.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We will discuss what property plant and equipment is and how to record property plant and equipment. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple depreciation methods will be covered including the straight-line depreciation method, the double declining depreciation method, and the units of production depreciation method.

The test has just been updated for February 2021. This is the first test in a series that covers the knowledge and skills of basic nursing you\u2019ll need as a new certified nursing assistant (CNA). The questions are based on the same categories that are included in the official exam. The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint. If you still make a mistake, you\u2019ll see the correct response displayed along with an explanation to help you understand. If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator. The skills test portion is about 35-45 minutes and covers five or more skills.</p><p><strong>Alternate names:</strong></p><p>A CNA test is also known as:</p><ul><li><p>Certified Nursing Assistant examination</p></li><li><p>Nursing assistant test</p></li><li><p>CNA knowledge test</p></li><li><p>CNA exam</p></li><li><p>Nurse assistant test</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why CNAs are important</strong></p><p>Certified Nursing Assistants are vital members of the health care team.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4162470", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Language Learning", "title": "The 150 Most Important Irregular Verbs in English.

It takes courage, endeavor and commitment<br>to live in a new country and participate fully as a citizen. We value your contribution to our peaceful and<br>democratic society. Australian citizenship is an important step in your migration story.</p><p>The <strong>Australian citizenship test</strong> plays a valuable role in encouraging people to find out more about Australia, as well as understanding the responsibilities and privileges being an Australian citizen brings. All the information you need to pass the test is in the citizenship test resource Australian Citizenship: Our Common Bond.</p><p><br></p><p>About Australia Citizenship Practice Test:</p><p>\u2013 The test is in English<br>\u2013 consists of 20 multiple choice questions, and<br>\u2013 You must answer %75 of the questions correct in order to pass.<br>\u2013 There is not a separate English language test but you will need a basic knowledge of English to pass the test.</p><p>Before you can set the citizenship test, you must apply for citizenship. Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4441154", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Excel Accounting 3 \u2013 Enter First Month of Transactions", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "316", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "6", "students": "8322", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4441154_e1d6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-accounting-3-enter-first-month-of-transactions/?couponCode=D81B1C7FF0A667AFF485", "end_day": "2022-04-24 05:49:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to enter transactions, & their impact on general ledger, subsidiary ledgers, trial balance, & financial stmts", "description": "<p>In this course we will enter common financial transactions for the first month of operations into an accounting system set up using an Excel worksheet.</p><p>Learners will learn how to navigate Microsoft Excel as well as how to use a well-designed accounting worksheet, complete with a general journal, trial balance, general ledger, subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable, accounts payable, &amp; inventory, financial statements and much more.</p><p>Excel is a very good tool to learn accounting because it is much more transparent than a database program, like accounting software, QuickBooks being a common example of accounting software.</p><p>For most new steps in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps being completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.</p><p>As we enter financial transactions, we will discuss common data input forms used to enter the transactions by accounting software like QuickBooks.

It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran.

PgMP certification holders oversee the success of a program \u2014 a way to group multiple, related projects to achieve benefits that may not be realized if the projects were managed in a stand-alone fashion. As project managers advance in their careers, the experience they gain in managing multiple, related projects and making decisions that advance strategic and business objectives demonstrates this competence. As employers demand program managers who can support the strategic objectives of the organization, PgMP certification holders will gain a distinct advantage in employment and promotional opportunities over their peers. PgMP Certifying Process Overview You must pass two evaluations to obtain the PgMP certification. This process takes approximately 60 days to complete. Evaluation 1\u2014Panel Review: The initial evaluation occurs through an extensive application review during which a panel of certified program managers will assess your professional experience based on your responses to the Program Management Experience Summaries provided on the application. Evaluation 2\u2014Multiple-Choice Examination: The next step occurs with the multiple-choice examination in which you will be called upon to demonstrate your competence in both situational and scenario-basedquestions.</p><p><br></p><p>About PMI\u2019s Certification Program PMI offers a comprehensive certification program for practitioners with different levels of education and experience. The certifications are developed and maintained through a vigorous process. The certification program includes: Certified Associate in Project Management(CAPM)\u00ae certification PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)\u00ae certification PMI Risk Management Professional(PMI-RMP)\u00aecertification PMI Scheduling Professional(PMI-SP)\u00aecertification Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP) \u00ae certification Program Management Professional (PgMP)\u00ae certification Project Management Professional(PMP)\u00ae certification PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)\u00ae certification PMI\u2019s certifications are distinguished by their global development and application, which makes them transferable across industries and geographic borders. The strength of PMI\u2019s certifications is that they are portable and not tied to any single method, standard or organization. PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3425614", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Ethical Hacking -

One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome.

Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells.

These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA.

It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.</p><p>In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).</p><p>Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1846798", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Other Business", "title": "Accounting-Bonds Payable, Notes Payable, Liabilities", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "955", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "107", "students": "32816", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1846798_4b76.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/accounting-bonds-payable-notes-payable-liabilities/?couponCode=C7CB57BD7A524448815D", "end_day": "2022-04-24 06:41:00+00:00", "headline": "Accounting for bonds and notes payable including the recording of bond discount and premium, present value calculations.", "description": "<p><strong>Bonds payable, notes payable, and liabilities will introduce the concept of bonds from a corporate perspective and explain how to record the issuance of bonds and notes payable. </strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss the journal entry for issuing bonds at par value, at a discount, and at a premium. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will cover present value calculations in multiple formats.

It grants citizenship for all those who will pass the exam and was meant to facilitate immigrants and refugees to settle permanently in Canada.</p><p><strong>The Cost of a Wonderful Living</strong></p><p>Now what are the requirements that you need to submit and present to obtain a Canadian citizenship?</p><ul><li><p>People aged over 18yrs. Old are eligible to take the exam</p></li><li><p>Must be able to speak and write any of Canada\u2019s official languages (English and French)</p></li><li><p>Have been settling in Canada for 3 years out of the last 5 years before the day of application.</p></li><li><p>Have filed all taxes for at least 3 years during the last 5 years, note that all income taxes that you owe must be fully paid.</p></li></ul><p>Canadian Citizenship can only be obtained through a legal permanent residency in Canada or through the following.</p><p><strong>If the person is under 18 years of age,</strong> the guardian or the parent of the applicant will have to apply on behalf of them for a citizenship.</p><p><strong>If the person is over 18 years of age and have children,</strong> he/she can include application with your own.</p><p>Fast track citizenship application process is given to any member of the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces.</strong></p><p>Upon the day of the test, the applicant must present a letter of consent from the government informing the authorities on the actual day of your test, followed by an informal interview that can take up to 30 minutes and you will be asked to provide all the necessary documents for the citizenship test.</p><p>Each applicant must bring the following,</p><ul><li><p>Record of Landing (IMM 1000) or <em>Confirmation of Permanent Residence</em> (IMM 5292)</p></li><li><p>Permanent Resident Card (PRC).</p></li><li><p>One identity document which includes the applicant\u2019s photograph with signature.</p></li><li><p>Passports and all travel documents that the applicant possess.</p></li><li><p>Original copies of all supporting documents such as <em>Birth Certificate, Marriage Contract etc.</em></p></li></ul><p>After submitting the requirements, it will now be verified through the following information,</p><ul><li><p>Signature of the applicant on the notice form is necessary.</p></li><li><p>The signature provided in the notice form will be verified by comparing it to the signatures in the applicant\u2019s supporting documents.</p></li><li><p>Photos provided along with the supporting documents will be verified against the person in front of the official. This is the reason why your actual presence is really important.</p></li></ul><p>Take note, that applicants who fail to prove their identity will not be allowed to take the actual test. Citizenship officers will then check the original copies and will coordinate the authenticity of these documents to the corresponding consular offices.</p><p>Only those who completed the requirements will continue to take the exam, only certified copies or original copies of documents can be accepted as proof of application unless the applicant is currently applying for a replacement of certificate.</p><p>Now that the requirements are ready, time to schedule and pass the Canadian Citizenship Exam.</p><p><strong>The Test of Fate</strong></p><p>The test is based on a study guide by the government to determine the applicant\u2019s knowledge in Canadian history, geography, culture and politics.</p><p>The citizenship exam lasts for 30 minutes with 20 multiple questions, applicants who are taking up the exam must answer at least 15 correct questions out of 20 to pass the exam.</p><p>Passing rate for the last 5 years is more than 60%, but rest assured that this test is not as easy as your history lessons. The exam is totally different, imagine for instance, an immigrant who have been a Filipino citizen for his entire life might face the most difficult written exam in his entire life. For the test focuses on a wide range of subject matters such as:</p><ul><li><p>Rights and Responsibilities of a Canadian Citizen</p></li><li><p>Canadian History</p></li><li><p>Canadian Political Systems</p></li><li><p>Canadian Physical and Political Geography</p></li></ul><p>Canadian roots and population will also be portrayed in the exam and the applicant must have an idea on how they value democracy, gender equality and human rights.</p><p>The exam is usually written, however in some cases, this test might be done in oral depending on the situation. The test is divided into different stages, from the history of the native people who first lived in Canada, the language that they use, their culture and the early form of their civilization. The first segment of the exam focuses more on the history of the first people in Canada and the language that they use although out the colonial period.</p><p>Taking up the exam means to study the entire history, demographics and geography of Canada. After finishing the first segment of the exam, it will be followed by a test on Modern Day Canada, Economy and Symbolism. This test shows you the actual scenario of what it means to become a real Canadian Citizen and embracing the history and rich culture of Canada.</p><p><strong>By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.</strong></p><p>There different institutions and online practices that you can find to sharpen your deep knowledge about the Canadian history, culture, roots and politics. Prepare yourself and begin to ready your history books and take up online courses for the exam only allows you have 5 wrong answer, answer all the questions and if you do not know the answer, a 25% chance of guessing the right answer might help you out. Read much and study harder before the exam but make sure not to put too much pressure on it. Get some rest and a decent sleep before the day of examination. Relax, read and understand the questions.</p><p><strong>After Passing the Exam</strong></p><p>If the applicant met the requirements of having a minimum of 15 correct answers and when the official has done verifying the authenticity of the applicant\u2019s documents. He/she will be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony within 4-6 months or might receive another questionnaire requesting more evidence of living in Canada.</p><p>After passing the exam, the citizenship authorities will provide the exact date and time of the citizenship ceremony, in the ceremony, the applicant will begin to take an Oath of Citizenship announcing that he is now legally and officially a Canadian citizen. After the Oathtaking, the applicant\u2019s citizenship certificate will be given.</p><p>Try not to worry more about the residency questionnaire, for it will only ask the applicant to provide more evidence of his living in Canada. Usually this is given to those who have traveled a lot outside Canada or those who have complexity in the application. Once the applicant receives this residency questionnaire, he will be invited for an interview once again with the citizenship officer and might ask for more supportive documents.</p><p><strong>A hope for those who failed the Citizenship Test</strong></p><p>If the applicant failed to pass exam but meet all the requirements to become a Canadian citizen, the Citizenship Officer will recommend the applicant to retake the exam or reschedule a second test. This could happen within 4-8 weeks after the commencement of the first one. The applicant must confirm his attendance for the second exam to the authorities immediately. During the second exam, the applicant will also receive the results on the same day. If the applicant, once again failed the exam he will be invited by a citizenship judge for an interview that usually takes 30-90 minutes. You will be asked a lot of questions orally on why you need to become a Canadian citizen. The judge would want to know the motives of your application and might ask the legitimacy of the time that you spent living in Canada. This interview will also test your English or French language skills as well as your knowledge about Canada.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4470532", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "UiPath Certification RPA Developer UiARD Practice Test -2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Golden Academy", "duration": "0", "rating": "2.0", "reviews": "5", "students": "1875", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4470532_951c.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/uipath-certification-rpa-developer-uiard-practice-test-2022/?couponCode=A8AE524D82E370DAD836", "end_day": "2022-04-25 14:05:00+00:00", "headline": "UiPath Certified Advanced RPA Developer (UiARD) : 120 questions waiting just for you, get it now!", "description": "<p><strong>UiPath Advanced RPA Developer Certification</strong> is targeted to assess a deeper level of knowledge and skills for designing and developing complex RPA solutions.</p><p>A typical candidate for achieving this level is expected to have 6+ months of working experience in developing RPA solutions and is ready to work independently on complex automation projects.</p><p>UiARD assesses a deeper level of RPA expertise covering the Robotic Enterprise Framework:<br><br>Setting up, testing and monitoring automated workflows to ensure that business processes function at optimum efficiency without risk of error. ...

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

The starting point will generally be our prior financial statements, including our prior balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.</p><p>We will then consider changes that we expect to take place, including those we plan on making and changes to the economy and business environment.</p><p>When constructing our budgets will need to go in a systematic order. We usually need to start with a sales projection because other projections will depend on it.</p><p>Our budget process can then consider the production plan. We can then move to the capital budget, cash budget, and budgeted income statement. The budgeted income statement is our primary performance statement.</p><p>Once we have the beginning balance sheet and the projected income statement, we can create the projected balance sheet, the statement representing where we expect to be at the end of the budgeted time frame.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4575244", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Science", "title": "School Chemistry Class 12 Practical Tests and Answers", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "2495", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4575244_b901.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/school-chemistry-class-12-practical-tests-and-answers/?couponCode=620DB9E67ACF928A43EF", "end_day": "2022-04-25 16:23:00+00:00", "headline": "[Part 2 of 2] Chemistry Lovers Save your Time and Effort \u2026..

Chemistry Class 12 Practical Tests and Answers</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chemistry</strong> is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.</p><p>In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).</p><p>Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1346902", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Microsoft", "title": "EXCEL para principiantes enfocado a los  negocios", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Johnny Mora", "duration": "242", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "3883", "students": "110604", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1346902_f5cb_6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/excelparanegocios/?couponCode=22C0A72C214BAECF4E80", "end_day": "2022-04-23 18:31:00+00:00", "headline": "\u00bbCurso Excel pensando en principiantes para productividad en los negocios y empresas actualizado a la ultima versi\u00f3n \u00ab", "description": "<p><strong>\u00bfAlguna vez te has preguntado c\u00f3mo empresas usan Excel en el manejo de sus datos?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Realizado con la ultima versi\u00f3n disponible para 2021 de este programa.

The questions are based on the same categories that are included in the official exam. The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint.

If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1963332", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Curso B\u00e1sico de Kali Linux com NMap para pentest e hacking", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Marco Aur\u00e9lio Thompson", "duration": "204", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "1695", "students": "24675", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1963332_5e8d_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/conhecer-kali-linux-facil-e-rapido/?couponCode=REALDISCOUNT3C", "end_day": "2022-04-27 03:40:00+00:00", "headline": "Atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o 2021.

It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is a subfield of microbiology.</p><p>The identification of the causative agent of tobacco mosaic disease (TMV) as a novel pathogen by Martinus Beijerinck (1898) is now acknowledged as being the official beginning of the field of virology as a discipline distinct from bacteriology. He realized the source was neither a bacterial nor a fungal infection, but something completely different. Beijerinck used the word \u2018virus\u2019 to describe the mysterious agent in his \u2018contagium vivum fluidum\u2019 (\u2018contagious living fluid\u2019). Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955.</p><p>A major branch of virology is virus classification. Viruses can be classified according to the host cell they infect: animal viruses, plant viruses, fungal viruses, and bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacteria, which include the most complex viruses). Another classification uses the geometrical shape of their capsid (often a helix or an icosahedron) or the virus's structure (e.g. presence or absence of a lipid envelope). Viruses range in size from about 30 nm to about 450 nm, which means that most of them cannot be seen with light microscopes. The shape and structure of viruses has been studied by electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.</p><p>The most useful and most widely used classification system distinguishes viruses according to the type of nucleic acid they use as genetic material and the viral replication method they employ to coax host cells into producing more viruses:</p><ul><li><p>DNA viruses (divided into double-stranded DNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses),</p></li><li><p>RNA viruses (divided into positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and the much less common double-stranded RNA viruses),</p></li><li><p>reverse transcribing viruses (double-stranded reverse-transcribing DNA viruses and single-stranded reverse-transcribing RNA viruses including retroviruses).</p></li></ul><p>Virologists also study <em>subviral particles</em>, infectious entities notably smaller and simpler than viruses:</p><ul><li><p>viroids (naked circular RNA molecules infecting plants),</p></li><li><p>satellites (nucleic acid molecules with or without a capsid that require a helper virus for infection and reproduction), and</p></li><li><p>prions (proteins that can exist in a pathological conformation that induces other prion molecules to assume that same conformation).</p></li></ul><p>Taxa in virology are not necessarily monophyletic, as the evolutionary relationships of the various virus groups remain unclear. Three hypotheses regarding their origin exist:</p><ol><li><p>Viruses arose from non-living matter, separately from yet in parallel to cells, perhaps in the form of self-replicating RNA ribozymes similar to viroids.</p></li><li><p>Viruses arose by genome reduction from earlier, more competent cellular life forms that became parasites to host cells and subsequently lost most of their functionality; examples of such tiny parasitic prokaryotes are Mycoplasma and Nanoarchaea.</p></li><li><p>Viruses arose from mobile genetic elements of cells (such as transposons, retrotransposons or plasmids) that became encapsulated in protein capsids, acquired the ability to \"break free\" from the host cell and infect other cells.</p></li></ol><p>Of particular interest here is mimivirus, a giant virus that infects amoebae and encodes much of the molecular machinery traditionally associated with bacteria. Two possibilities are that it is a simplified version of a parasitic prokaryote or it originated as a simpler virus that acquired genes from its host.</p><p>The evolution of viruses, which often occurs in concert with the evolution of their hosts, is studied in the field of viral evolution.</p><p>While viruses reproduce and evolve, they do not engage in metabolism, do not move, and depend on a host cell for reproduction. The often-debated question of whether they are alive or not is a matter of definition that does not affect the biological reality of viruses.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2352930", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Management", "title": "Responsibility Accounting & Performance Measurement", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "457", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "97", "students": "36190", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2352930_9b05.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/responsibility-accounting-performance-measurement/?couponCode=67EF865A8AEEBB9218D1", "end_day": "2022-04-24 06:33:00+00:00", "headline": "Managerial accounting tools of responsibility accounting and other performance measures related to decentralization", "description": "<p><strong>Responsibility accounting &amp; performance measures.</strong></p><p><strong>We will describe the concept of decentralization, how it applies to businesses, and the pros and cons of a more decentralized organization from a centralized one.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will cover general managerial accounting concepts necessary to study responsibility accounting, comparing and contrasting managerial accounting and financial accounting.</strong></p><p><strong>We will explain what a responsibility accounting system looks like and the benefits of a responsibility accounting system.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss the categorization of costs between direct costs and indirect costs and why this categorization between direct and indirect is useful for reporting financial data by department.</strong></p><p><strong>We will describe the problems with allocating indirect costs to the proper departments and explain various methods for allocating indirect costs.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will describe what a departmental income statement is and how to create a departmental income statement.</strong></p><p><strong>We will explore what a forecasted departmental income statement is and put together a forecasted departmental income statement.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss other performance measures like return on investment (ROI) and a balance scorecard.</strong></p><p><strong>We will also complete a comprehensive problem using preformatted Excel worksheets and step by step instructional videos.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3821086", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Fundamentos da Criptografia, Esteganografia e Criptoan\u00e1lise", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Marco Aur\u00e9lio Thompson", "duration": "88", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "51", "students": "2749", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3821086_0acd_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentos-da-criptografia/?couponCode=REALDISCOUNT1C", "end_day": "2022-04-27 03:43:00+00:00", "headline": "Fundamentos da criptografia, esteganografia e criptoan\u00e1lise para pentest, ethical hacking e per\u00edcia computacional.", "description": "<p>Criptografia est\u00e1 na moda.

Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.</p><p>Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.</p><p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p><p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3694090", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "T-Shirt Business Mastery 2022  | Full Blueprint From 0 to 1", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Henry Zhang", "duration": "53", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "51", "students": "20847", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3694090_39de_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/t-shirt-business-mini-course/?couponCode=65DA3A08AD5C653DD533", "end_day": "2022-04-25 23:09:00+00:00", "headline": "How to uncover the secrets of starting business designing and selling t-shirts successfully with minimum costs quickly !", "description": "<p><strong>You can make BIG MONEY selling your T-shirt designs online!</strong></p><p><strong>The T-Shirt Business Course For EVERY Level</strong></p><p>This course is your fast track to T-Shirt Business success and will provide long-lasting value from your very first product designed right through to advanced sales and marketing campaigns.

For applicants who met the admissions criteria and successfully submitted their application, the chance of acceptance was 70%.<br></p><p>The reasons for this high number of unsuccessful applications are mainly twofold. First, there weren\u2019t enough spaces, or funding, available for so many applicants, and second, despite meeting admission criteria, many applicants were beaten by others with better scores.<br></p><p>The good news is that the nursing sector is growing at a rate of 16%, which is quite fast, meaning that nearly half a million new jobs will exist by 2024. The other good news is that you can do a lot of preparation to boost your scores and increase your chances of being accepted into your preferred program.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do I beat the competition?</strong></p><p>Based on the data above, it it safe to assume that from the outset, your application has a 50% chance of being successful. To increase your chances, prepare for the challenges you need to overcome. One of the challenges you have more control over is the TEAS test. If ATI Testing\u2019s TEAS test is part of your application, the following ten steps can help you better prepare and increase your chances of not only getting the grades required, but exceeding them. Beat the competition, boost your confidence, and ace the TEAS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY</strong></p><p><strong><em>Smarter not Harder</em></strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4353586", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Science", "title": "general mycology a brief review", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Mohamed AL ashram", "duration": "57", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "18", "students": "2210", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4353586_02f6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/general-mycology-a-brief-review/?couponCode=85D32CB618C107E2C9CD", "end_day": "2022-04-23 17:36:00+00:00", "headline": "general mycology", "description": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Topics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>In this course you find</p><p>introduction</p><p>history of science development</p><p>Morphology of fungi</p><p>Growth of fungi</p><p>Metabolism of fungi </p><p>Genetics f fungi</p><p>Diseases caused by fungi Allergies Mycosis Mycotoxin</p><p>Laboratory diagnosis of fungi</p><p>Antifungal Drugs used in treatment fungal diseases</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p> HISTORY OF THE SCIENCE GIVE AN IDEA OF ITS&nbsp; DEVELOPEMENT STAGES</p><p> The term \"mycology\" is derived from Greek word \"mykes\" meaning mushroom.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore mycology is the study of fungi The ability of fungi to invade plant and animal tissue was observed in early 19th century but the first documented animal infection by any fungus was made by Augastino Bassi , who in 1835 studied the muscardine disease of silkworm proved that the infection was caused by a fungus Beauveria bassiana. Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \"stone\" in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles' successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.</p><p> LEARN Harmful Effects of Fungi: </p><p>1. Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp;

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model. </p></li><li><p><strong>Part 3 (Section 7-11) - Creating ANN model in Python</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>We also understand the importance of libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow in this part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 4 (Section 12) - CNN Theoretical Concepts</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn about convolutional and pooling layers which are the building blocks of CNN models.</p><p>In this section, we will start with the basic theory of convolutional layer, stride, filters and feature maps. We also explain how gray-scale images are different from colored images. Lastly we discuss pooling layer which bring computational efficiency in our model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 5 (Section 13-14) - Creating CNN model in Python<br></strong>In this part you will learn how to create CNN models in Python.</p><p>We will take the same problem of recognizing fashion objects and apply CNN model to it. We will compare the performance of our CNN&nbsp;model with our ANN model and notice that the accuracy increases by 9-10% when we use CNN. However, this is not the end of it. We can further improve accuracy by using certain techniques which we explore in the next part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 6 (Section 15-18) - End-to-End Image Recognition project in Python<br></strong>In this section we build a complete image recognition project on colored images.</p><p>We take a Kaggle image recognition competition and build CNN&nbsp;model to solve it. With a simple model we achieve nearly 70% accuracy on test set. Then we learn concepts like Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning which help us improve accuracy level from 70% to nearly 97% (as good as the winners of that competition).</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a Convolutional Neural Network model in Python will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use CNN to create predictive models and solve image recognition problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below are some popular FAQs of students who want to start their Deep learning journey-</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use Python for Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Deep Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Deep Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3462432", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Burp Suite Basics", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "45", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "31", "students": "5598", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3462432_3493.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/burp-suite-course/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42205", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:28:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Burp Suite Basics", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to do use Burp Suite but don\u2019t know where to start?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Would you like to learn how to use Burp Suite?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Then Burp Suite Basics is for you!&nbsp; </p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Burp Suite is a in-demand skill in 2021.&nbsp; </p><p>The course begins with the basics.

So, if you want to create an unforgettable first impression, it is very important that you prepare yourself with the correct tools and techniques before you even go to meet the person in question whom you want to impress or go to the event/interview.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked this one question to the many decision-makers all over the world \"If you would like to see the change that will make your organization more productive, what would it be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody came back with one word and they said ATTITUDE. If people had a better disposition, they would have better team coordination, quality would go up, the bottom line would go up, and obviously, success is bound to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that 85% of the time a person gets a job or a promotion is because of the disposition? ONLY 15% depends on how intelligent they are or how many facts and figures they know.</p><p><br></p><p>And almost 100% of the education dollars go to teaching facts and figures which accounts for only 15% of the success, and what we are talking about in this course is 85%. This is what brings us to a point that it is not our position but our disposition that determines our success.</p><p>Now, once you are standing in front of the person you want to impress, you want to make sure that you connect with them on a personal as well as a professional level. Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is through the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.

The abbreviation \"IQ\" was coined by the psychologist William Stern for the German term <em>Intelligenzquotient</em>, his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912 book.</p><p>Historically, IQ was a score obtained by dividing a person's mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person's chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months. The resulting fraction (quotient) was multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score. For modern IQ tests, the raw score is transformed to a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15.This results in approximately two-thirds of the population scoring between IQ 85 and IQ 115 and about 2.5 percent each above 130 and below 70.</p><p>Scores from intelligence tests are estimates of intelligence. Unlike, for example, distance and mass, a concrete measure of intelligence cannot be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of \"intelligence\".IQ scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as nutrition,[8][9] parental socioeconomic status,morbidity and mortality,[12][13] parental social status,[14] and perinatal environment.While the heritability of IQ has been investigated for nearly a century, there is still debate about the significance of heritability estimates[16][17] and the mechanisms of inheritance.</p><p>IQ scores are used for educational placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants.

As we focus on the differences, we always want to keep in mind the similarities in accounting for different business entities. Most of what we have learned about the double entry accounting system and day to day accounting transactions in prior courses will remain the same. We are concentrating on the areas that will different because the differences are where the new information lies. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will start by defining what a partnership is and comparing the characteristics of a partnership with other business entities. Understanding one business entity and its components are often best learned by contrasting them with the attributes of others, always considering the relative pros and cons, thinking of situations and circumstances that would benefit one form of business entity over another. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will discuss the process for setting up a new partnership, typically starting with the partners contributing capital to the partnership, requiring us to record the contribution and the capital accounts. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will discuss the allocation of net income to the partners, one of the primary differences between a partnership type of entity and other types of entities. There is a lot of flexibility for net income allocation in a partnership, and this is one of its primary benefits. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will cover the recording of partnership draws, how to record them, as well as the closing process for a partnership. The steps of the closing process will be much the same as those for any business entity except for the allocation of net income to the partners. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will consider the situation where a partner leaves a partnership or where a new partner is added. The transactions related to a partner leaving or being added is unique to a partnership entity. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will cover a partnership liquidation process or closing process. The liquidation process is a very useful exercise for any entity because it allows us to do take apart a business. We have discussed the process of putting new busses together in prior courses, but to fully understand how something works we must also take it apart. The liquidation process is particularly important for a partnership entity because it emphasizes the capital accounts and the process necessary to reduce the likelihood of problems during the process. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We also include a comprehensive problem designed to take a step back and consider all the similarities between business entities so that we can put the differences we have studied in this course into perspective.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Which all classification techniques are taught in this course?</strong></p><p>In this course we learn both parametric and non-parametric classification techniques. The primary focus will be on the following three techniques:</p><ol><li><p>Logistic Regression</p></li><li><p>Linear Discriminant Analysis</p></li><li><p>K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) </p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Classification techniques of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Classification is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn classification starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of classification.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4316848", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Certified Information System Security Professional-Exam 2021", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Abhishek Gupta", "duration": "0", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "1", "students": "1688", "coupon_code": "7A215191B5782E5C9913", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4316848_cfca_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-information-system-security-professional/?couponCode=31190EEA5562BD5AB520", "end_day": "2022-04-27 08:59:00+00:00", "headline": "Latest 100+ Test Questions for Certified Information Systems Security Professional Practice Test 2021 |new CISSP 2021 |", "description": "<p>Become an <strong>Certified Information Systems Security Professional 2021 (CISSP) </strong>in First Attempt with <strong>900+ Score</strong></p><p>An <strong>Certified Information Systems Security Professional certifications</strong> practice test module to introspect and enhance your <strong>CISSP</strong> learning's</p><p>These <strong>Certified Information Systems Security Professional practice exams</strong> are a combination of multiple modules of the entire course and have been designed as per the reviews and pattern of the original examination paper.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you.
