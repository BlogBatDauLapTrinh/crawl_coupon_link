Master of business administration MBA professional exam questions and answers.</p><p><br></p><p>A <strong>Master of Business Administration</strong> (<strong>MBA</strong>; also <strong>Master's in Business Administration</strong>) is a graduate degree focusing on business administration, investment management, healthcare administration and psychology. The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business administration such as accounting, healthcare, applied statistics, human resources, business communication, business ethics, business law, strategic management, business strategy, finance, psychology, managerial economics, management, entrepreneurship, marketing, supply-chain management, and operations management in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. It originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific management.</p><p>Most programs also include elective courses and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example, accounting, finance, marketing, and human resources. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about forty to sixty credits (sixty to ninety in a quarter system), much higher than the thirty credits (thirty-six to forty-five in a quarter system) typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the Master of Economics, Master of Finance, Master of Accountancy, Master of Science in Marketing and Master of Science in Management.</p><p>The MBA is a terminal degree and a professional degree.[3][4] Accreditation bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, executive (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and distance learning students, many with specialized concentrations.</p><p>The \"Executive MBA\", or EMBA, is a degree program similar to a MBA program, but is specifically structured for and targeted towards corporate executives and senior managers who are already in the workforce.</p><p><br></p><p>The Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MFT-MBA) contains 124 multiple-choice questions, half of which are based on short case-study scenarios. Programs can choose when and where to administer the test. The test, which must be given by a proctor, is designed to take three hours and may be split into two sessions. Mathematical operations do not require the use of a calculator. Most of the questions require knowledge of specific information drawn from four content areas: marketing, management, finance and managerial accounting. Some questions require strategic integration skills \u2014 the ability to integrate knowledge of two or more content areas. The test also includes questions that focus on: international business, information technology, the legal and regulatory environment, business ethics and social responsibility, quantitative analysis, and managerial economics. A unique feature of MFT-MBA design is the capability of measuring critical thinking ability \u2014 that is, the test assesses the ability to: \u2022 analyze and interpret data \u2022 apply concepts and ideas \u2022 analyze theories and relationships deductively and inductively The overall scaled score measures critical thinking and reasoning within the domain of a standard MBA curriculum. While MBA curricula encompass many subfields and specialties, the MFT-MBA examination is designed to assess skills and subject matter common to most programs.

converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called <em>digital representation</em> or, more specifically, a <em>digital image</em>, for the object, and <em>digital form</em>, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitate processing by digital computers and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.</p><p>Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\". Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organizations around the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Haytham H.

It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.</p><p>A Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).</p><p>It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!</p><p>This course will help you explore how working on an Agile project using Kanban has benefits for your development team, your end users, and your organization as a whole.</p><p>We will identify various process flow related issues including too much work in progress, underutilization of resources, lengthy tasks, unequal sized tasks etc. using simple and easy to understand demonstrations on Kanban board.</p><p>We will not only identify these inefficiencies but also solve for the same by continuously improving the process flow using Kanban Board.</p><p>Here is a list of the topics we will cover in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to Kanban &amp; Kanban Board</p></li><li><p>Finding Inefficiencies in the Process</p></li><li><p>Limiting Work in Progress</p></li><li><p>Under utilization of Resources</p></li><li><p>Unequal Sized Tasks</p></li><li><p>Marking the Tasks</p></li><li><p>Other Inefficiencies/Issues</p></li></ul><p><em>Kanban Practices</em></p><ul><li><p>Defining Done</p></li><li><p>Daily Stand up</p></li><li><p>Specifying Rules</p></li></ul><p><em>Key Agile Concepts</em></p><ul><li><p>Understanding &amp; Creating <strong>User Stories, Theme &amp; Epic</strong></p></li><li><p>What is <strong>Product Backlog</strong></p></li><li><p>Difference between <strong>Product Backlog &amp; Product Roadmap</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Agile</strong></p></li><li><p>How <strong>Estimation</strong> is done in Agile</p></li><li><p>Why <strong>Relative Estimation</strong> in Agile</p></li><li><p><strong>T-Shirt &amp; Fibonacci</strong> Estimation</p></li><li><p><strong>Planing Poker</strong> in Agile</p></li><li><p><strong>Understanding &amp; Creating Burn down Charts </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Team Velocity</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is ideal for <strong>software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone that would have an interest and gain benefit from running an Agile project and delivering maximum value early to your customers.</strong></p><p>No prior experience is necessary to take this course.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</p><p>Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The term <em>Six Sigma</em> originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a <em>sigma</em> rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.</p><p>Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p><p>In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\".</p><p>In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3563897", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "2022 NEW PMBOK 7th Version of Agile PMI-PMP Exam PMP", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "23", "students": "12707", "coupon_code": "FFBF0B4030650902E8F6", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3563897_349c_6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/6-new-versions-of-the-new-pmp-exams-2021-6th-edition/?couponCode=FFBF0B4030650902E8F6", "end_day": "2021-11-30 08:59:54+00:00", "headline": "NEW PMBOK 7th \u2026  Agile PMI PMP 6th edition Preparation 715 UPDATED UNIQUE questions and detailed answers", "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Agile PMP&nbsp;EXAM&nbsp;SIMULATOR 2022</strong></p><p><strong>NEW&nbsp;PMBOK 7th</strong></p><p><strong>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</strong></p><p><strong>This New REAL&nbsp;LATEST&nbsp;VERSION EXAMS 200 Q and&nbsp; A&nbsp; Exam aligns to the new PMP 2021 Exam Content Outline</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Project Management Professional PMP </strong>is an <strong>internationally recognized professional designation</strong> offered by the Project Management Institute <strong>PMI</strong> .

Make a checklist of things you need to have organized for the morning of the exam well in advance and then</p><p>use the checklist. Nothing is more disruptive to your concentration and ability to do your best than</p><p>unexpected problems or stress. The following are examples of things that might be part of your checklist:</p><p>a. Be sure you have the required two forms of signature-bearing identification, one of which has your</p><p>photograph, in order to be admitted to the exam.</p><p>b. You can and should bring a six-function calculator \u2013 make sure the batteries are fresh.</p><p>c. Be sure your car has plenty of gasoline.</p><p>d. Have a backup plan for such things as child care, if relevant.</p><p>2. Do not spend more than one hour with your study materials on the evening before the exam. At this point,</p><p>additional studying will harm more than help. Your brain needs time and relaxation to establish long-term</p><p>memory traces. Plan a quiet, relaxing evening doing something you find personally fulfilling.</p><p>3. Avoid a heavy meal the evening before the exam. A dinner that is high in carbohydrate and fiber and low in</p><p>fat will support you the best. Abstain from alcohol beginning not less than 48 hours and ideally 72 hours</p><p>before the scheduled exam. Do everything possible to ensure a good night\u2019s rest the night before the exam.</p><p>4. Do not skip breakfast the morning of the exam! High protein and complex carbohydrates and little or no sugar</p><p>will best sustain your concentration. Consume no caffeine or sugar within three hours of the start of the</p><p>exam. These substances are largely metabolized by the body within two hours, and their initial stimulating</p><p>effect is followed by a loss of concentration and energy for at least an hour thereafter.</p><p>5. Avoid stress the morning of the exam. If at all possible, take the morning off from work and go for a walk or</p><p>engage in other light, outdoor exercise. Your goal is to arrive at the exam site as fresh, relaxed and self-confident</p><p>as possible.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Thank you and Regards,</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Haytham H.
