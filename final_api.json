Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course in Tamil will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Tamil"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2032882", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Analytics & Intelligence", "title": "QuickBooks Pro-Business & Personal-One QuickBooks File", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "534", "rating": "3.3", "reviews": "35", "students": "19483", "coupon_code": "54A23DEEBA1271B8B854", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2032882_0a7d.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-pro-2019-business-personal-one-quickbooks-file/?couponCode=DD3A6758298FF14C9071", "end_day": "2022-04-28 06:15:00+00:00", "headline": "Both business and personal financial, bookkeeping, and tax information in one QuickBooks file using class tracking.", "description": "<p><strong>Both business and personal financial, bookkeeping, and tax information in one QuickBooks file using class tracking. </strong></p><p><strong>This course will demonstrate how to use the class tracking feature in QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019, applying the feature to tracking both business and personal financial information in one QuickBooks file. </strong></p><p><strong>Note that tracking both business and personal data in one QuickBooks file will not be the best option for many businesses but is a good option for small businesses who want one location to track and analyze financial data and generate financial reports that can be used for tax preparation, budgeting, and business planning. </strong></p><p><strong>We will set up a QuickBooks file designed for both business and personal use, discussing how to use the class tracking feature and creating a chart of accounts. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will enter financial data from a bank statement that has both business and personal transactions, separating the financial transactions using the class tracking feature as we enter the data into QuickBooks. </strong></p><p><strong>We will compare the method of using one QuickBooks account for both business and personal data to using two separate QuickBooks files, one for personal and one for business, listing and describing pros and cons of each method and when they would be best applied. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will also discuss how to track personal balance sheet items and provide practical examples and alternative methods. </strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss how to record and track personal investments in Quickbooks. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss how to enter financial data for the value of a home, the related home loan, and the mortgage payments that include both interest and principal portions. </strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss how to enter W-2 wages into QuickBooks to track our income, including a method for breaking out gross pay from the withholding amounts. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will cover different methods for tracking credit card balances and credit card payments. </strong></p><p><strong>We will also discuss methods for tracking the value of an automobile and the concept of prepaid expenses including how to record prepaid insurance.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4448816", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "Consulting Offer Creation Masterclass", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "The Academy for Coaches & Consultants TACC", "duration": "48", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "12", "students": "6792", "coupon_code": "54A23DEEBA1271B8B854", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4448816_ecbb_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/1-day-offer-creation/?couponCode=25APR22", "end_day": "2022-04-30 07:21:00+00:00", "headline": "How to Create a Great Consulting or Coaching Offer In 24 Hours (or Less)!", "description": "<p><strong>A good offer is at the heart of any business</strong>, and this is especially true for knowledge or service based businesses like coaching and consulting. </p><p>Having a good offer can be the difference between having a profitable business vs having a business that struggles to generate even a little amount of revenue, let alone profits. </p><p>Having a good offer can be the difference between having clients who come back for more vs clients who regret working with you. </p><p>And having a good offer can also be the difference between using what you know to make a difference vs having little to no positive impact whatsoever.&nbsp;

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey. Being a parent I know the toughest thing is to have your child express their feeling to you. We have covered this most important aspect of creative self-expression through different exercises and fun methods.</strong>&nbsp;</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2482036", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Lead Generation Mastery with Facebook Lead & Messenger Ads", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ing.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report.

Make sure you\u2019re sitting comfortably, as it\u2019s time to see how to put all the information you\u2019ve learned on copywriting into practice\u2026From your sales pages to your press releases, video scripts, blog post headlines meta descriptions, and email campaigns to your Facebook posts and Press releases, knowing how to create great copy will help your marketing efforts enormously. When you learn how to do it right, you'll be able to get higher conversion rates on key pages, improve the structure of your blogs, get more engagement in social media, and have many more people share your content.</p><p>Most importantly of all, you'll be able to understand your customer\u2019s needs, which will help you connect with your target audience much better. To create truly great copy, you first need to know your audience. You must understand what drives them, their hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears and desires.</p><p>Once you have this knowledge, you'll be able to write copy that immediately connects with the people you're trying to reach, because you'll be speaking their language. This will make all your content 100% more effective, and you'll find it easier to be able to get people to take the action you want. Knowing how to write good copy is an essential marketing skill, that will help you boost your reach, sell more, and get more customer engagement. </p><p>It will also make you much more employable, according to the national association of colleges and employers, 73% of employers want to hire people with strong writing skills.</p><p><strong>Get Max Attention From the Off</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click-throughs, you must use headers that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of headers are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make headers sound more specific: like 10 Top tips to get ripped fast, or 5 PRO ways to protect your privacy online. Don\u2019t just cast out clickbait headers that bear no relation to your content, or people will lose trust in you and switch off.</p><p><strong>Don\u2019t Evade Your Emotions</strong></p><p>While it\u2019s true that dropping stats and facts helps you build trust and credibility, if you do this too much, you\u2019ll end up boring people. Your copy needs a human element to be relatable, and one of the most powerful ways to achieve this is making your content emotional. Use high-impact words, and share funny stories, or situations your audience can relate to, so that they can put themselves right in the scenario. When you add an element of personality, you\u2019ll make your followers feel closer to you than to other content creators who play it safe and stick to the facts.</p><p><strong>Identify Your Audience\u2019s Pain Points</strong></p><p>Pain points are problems people stress about and look for a solution too. Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action. Let your your audience know they must act now<em> </em>if they want the solution.</p><p><strong>Learn Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p>Because of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a huge competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>When You Enrol, You Also Get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course Materials And Tuition Worth At Least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost</p></li><li><p>23 PRO Content Marketing Templates ready for download</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and Free Extra Resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes &amp; Assignments</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today</p></li><li><p>PDF Digital Nomad Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Starter pack for digital nomads</p></li><li><p>PDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically</p></li><li><p>PDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients</p></li><li><p>PDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination</p></li><li><p>PDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling</p></li><li><p>PDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value</p></li></ul><p><strong>Copywriting Has Become One of the Most-In-Demand Skills of 2022. </strong></p><p>In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year.

That\u2019s not true. The basics of SEO are actually quite simple. And with 58% of all web traffic coming from Google, it\u2019s certainly something worth learning about if you have a website. If you think the SEO fundamentals aren\u2019t enough to get you ranked, think again. Most people running websites have a very limited understanding of SEO, so knowing the fundamentals can certainly help you succeed.</p><p><strong>What are the Benefits of SEO?</strong></p><ul><li><p>SEO leads to more traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to consistent traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to \u2018free\u2019 traffic</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO Helps You to Rank Higher</strong></p><p>But you can\u2019t rank higher if Google doesn\u2019t even know your website exists in the first place. Getting your website indexed by search engines means you\u2019re in the race, not that you\u2019re likely to win. That\u2019s where SEO comes in. SEO is an ongoing process that, if done well, increases your chances of winning over time. It\u2019s much easier to do SEO well when your website is properly set up for SEO success.</p><p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business. And that content needs to reach audience members in a way that feels natural and organic versus being disruptive. Content marketing helps businesses do this, and it describes the process of attracting, engaging with, and delighting your target markets.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Has Become One of the Most In-demand Skills of 2022</strong></p><p>In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year. Why? Every business can benefit from someone who writes great copy. From startups to Fortune 500s and everything in between, copywriting can make or break the success of an organisation.</p><p>The truth of the matter is this; anyone can become a copywriter. You don\u2019t need a degree or specialised training to master this skill. So, whether you\u2019re looking to start a career as a freelance copywriter or just want to improve the copy for your own business, this guide will give you the blueprint for getting your feet wet with copywriting.</p><p>Copywriting is the art of writing text for marketing purposes. It\u2019s designed to sell your products or services while establishing a voice for your brand. The main intention of copywriting is to persuade people to take a particular action, whether it\u2019s purchasing, signing up for something, or any other type of conversion.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Comes in Many Different Forms: </strong></p><p>Advertisements, web pages, brochures, white papers, social media content, and company tag-lines would all fall into the copywriting category, and that\u2019s just barely scratching the surface.</p><p>But copywriting is much more than just words. Great copy tells a compelling story and represents your brand image. It pulls on the strings that trigger the decision-making process for whoever reads what you\u2019re writing. </p><p>Copywriting doesn\u2019t sell products or services; it sells emotion and lifestyle. According to Google Trends, the global interest in copywriting is currently at an all-time high, based on search data over the last ten years.</p><p><strong>When You Enrol, You Also Get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course materials and tuition worth at least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and free extra resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes - 308 Questions A, B, C, D &amp; 14 Assignments</p></li><li><p>Complete Overview of all 210&nbsp;Google SEO Ranking Factors</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money-back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today</p></li><li><p>PDF Digital Nomad Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Starter pack for digital nomads</p></li><li><p>PDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically</p></li><li><p>PDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients</p></li><li><p>PDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination</p></li><li><p>PDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling</p></li><li><p>PDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value</p></li></ul><p><strong>Start Your Journey to Google SEO &amp; Copywriting Today!</strong></p><p>Digital marketing can turn around your entire financial situation - <em>if </em>you know how to do it right.

Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website.

So why does it happen so often that projects are commenced without due consideration of the intended final destination?</p><p>Sure, you can <strong><em>initiate a project</em></strong> in any way you wish and realign it during planning and execution, but that goes against the grain of project management philosophy, which in essence circles around the idea of <strong><em>optimization</em></strong> of <strong><em>project effort</em></strong>. <strong><em>Initiating</em></strong> the project the <strong><em>right way</em></strong>, will not only <strong><em>simplify the project planning process</em></strong>, but it will also play a major role in early project effort efficiency and correct team orientation, which will ultimately add to the chances of <strong><em>avoiding</em></strong> any <strong><em>unnecessary</em></strong> project <strong><em>blunders</em></strong>.</p><p>In this course you will learn <strong>everything </strong>you need to know about the project <strong>initiating </strong>process group. Furthermore you will also gain a working understanding of the very important work that happens before a project can be initiated. <strong>Understanding pre-project</strong> work makes a big difference in your ability to <strong>start your project on the right foot. </strong>The knowledge you will gain in this course regarding project initiation and how to ensure you <strong>start the project the right way </strong>will prove to be <strong>invaluable</strong>. The techniques thought in this course will not only help you to effectively initiate your projects, but it will also ensure that you <strong>facilitate stakeholder alignment</strong> before project planning even starts, giving you a great head start and ensuring that you <strong>eliminate </strong>or at the very least <strong>limit </strong>the effect of two of the largest contributors to project failure namely <strong>lack of stakeholder engagement</strong> and <strong>misalignment of stakeholder expectations.</strong></p><p>This course was designed to arm you with the essential knowledge you require to lay the foundation upon which the remainder of your project will be built.</p><p>The course covers all of the essentials of <strong><em>pre-project work</em></strong> or project conception, which is the work done at a program or portfolio level that aims to ensure the <strong><em>viability</em></strong> and <strong><em>practicality</em></strong> of the project before it is even initiated. The <strong><em>stakeholder engagement techniques</em></strong> taught as part of the needs definition process will prove to be one of the most useful skills you can have as a project manager. The course then goes on to teach you what initiation is all about and how to compile a <strong><em>project</em></strong> <strong><em>charter</em></strong> containing all the <strong><em>precursor</em></strong> <strong><em>information</em></strong> you will need to <strong><em>effectively</em></strong> <strong><em>plan</em></strong> the project later on. Particular attention is given to the compilation of the initial scope that forms part of the charter and the techniques taught here will set the pace for the rest of the project. The course also covers <strong><em>stakeholder identification </em></strong>and <strong><em>analysis </em></strong>in detail. The last topic of the course is that of the project <strong><em>kick-off meeting</em></strong>, what its purpose is and how you can use it to get project team buy in.</p><p>Building a house on the wrong foundation will ultimately cause a countless problems later on and the same holds true for project management. This course will arm you with the knowledge you need to lay a strong foundation, ensuring you eliminate a lot of the problems that may have presented itself in the future had you not done so.</p><p>The course design caters for those who already have the foundational knowledge of project management and are familiar with the PMI project management methodology. Beginners are however welcome to take it up as well as the course is structured to add value to<strong> all project management professionals</strong>.</p><p>Newcomers to project management will find this knowledge very beneficial, as it will enable them to start projects the way they are supposed to be started, greatly reducing the chances of issues popping up in later project phases.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4165158", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "Tekla Structures shop drawing R.C.C Building", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Ahmad Traboulsi", "duration": "199", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "86", "students": "6557", "coupon_code": "54A23DEEBA1271B8B854", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4165158_7eb3_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tekla-structures-shop-drawing-rcc-building/?couponCode=7FA8FEBAFB859D4256C8", "end_day": "2022-04-30 08:58:00+00:00", "headline": "Shop drawing and modeling R.C.C building in TEKLA", "description": "<p>Tekla structures is a building information modeling software able to model structures that incorporate different kinds of building materials, including steel, concrete, timber, and glass.</p><p>Tekla structures the most advanced structural BIM&nbsp;software, lets you create, combine, manage and share multi-material 3D&nbsp;models packed with valuable construction information. </p><p>With Tekla structures you can create accurate information-rich 3D models that have all the structural data you need to build and maintain any type of structure. </p><p>You can also import, export and link your data with other software solutions, digital construction tools and fabrication machinery for smoother workflow.</p><p>In this course we will learn the <strong>shop drawing </strong>and <strong>modeling</strong> of a r<strong>einforcement concrete building consists of 4 stories.</strong> </p><p>We will learn how we can generate the shop drawings of all the structural elements (<strong>foundation layout, columns layout, beams layout, slab layout</strong>)</p><p>We will learn how we can do <strong>sections using Tekla</strong> to get more <strong>details drawings in beams or columns or foundations.</strong></p><p>We will learn how to generate the<strong> Bill of Quantity table in Tekla structure</strong></p><p> The dimensions and properties for structural sections commonly used in R.C.C building structure design and construction are given in this course in addition to all design consideration and&nbsp; proper material availability and specification according the <strong>ACI code.</strong></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1963332", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Curso B\u00e1sico de Kali Linux com NMap para pentest e hacking", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Marco Aur\u00e9lio Thompson", "duration": "204", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "1696", "students": "25326", "coupon_code": "54A23DEEBA1271B8B854", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1963332_5e8d_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/conhecer-kali-linux-facil-e-rapido/?couponCode=REALDISCOUNT3C", "end_day": "2022-04-27 03:40:00+00:00", "headline": "Atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o 2021.

If you're willing to learn and apply the knowledge I share with you,<em> I</em> can teach you the rest.</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm Interested, So What Will I Learn Exactly?</strong></p><p>First, you\u2019ll get a comprehensive, high quality video overview that will show you how to create facebook ads that deliver real results. I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish. </em>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits. <em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a Winning Facebook Ad Campaign, so you can see what you need to do and why. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select The Right Ad To Achieve Your Marketing Goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, engaging ads. Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel For Ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set Up Your First Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover The Customer Journey To Purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find Your Ideal Customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to hone in on your perfect customer. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting The Most Out Of The Facebook Pixel And Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and fast.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events To Take Your Ad Game To The Next Level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to get more from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Convert More, Sell Faster</strong></p><p>You'll receive my exclusive techniques for maximising your ad conversion rate on facebook. Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages. I'll be sharing what these are, and how you can easily implement them in my course.</p><p><strong>Create Compelling Ad Copy That Sells</strong></p><p>You'll also get a comprehensive quick start to copywriting master, so you can create copy that engages right off the bat.

That\u2019s not true. The basics of SEO are actually quite simple. And with 58% of all web traffic coming from Google, it\u2019s certainly something worth learning about if you have a website. If you think the SEO fundamentals aren\u2019t enough to get you ranked, think again. Most people running websites have a very limited understanding of SEO, so knowing the fundamentals can certainly help you succeed.</p><p><strong>What are the Benefits of SEO?</strong></p><ul><li><p>SEO leads to more traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to consistent traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to \u2018free\u2019 traffic</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO Helps You to Rank Higher</strong></p><p>But you can\u2019t rank higher if Google doesn\u2019t even know your website exists in the first place. Getting your website indexed by search engines means you\u2019re in the race, not that you\u2019re likely to win. That\u2019s where SEO comes in. SEO is an ongoing process that, if done well, increases your chances of winning over time. It\u2019s much easier to do SEO well when your website is properly set up for SEO success.</p><p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business. And that content needs to reach audience members in a way that feels natural and organic versus being disruptive. Content marketing helps businesses do this, and it describes the process of attracting, engaging with, and delighting your target markets.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Has Become One of the Most In-demand Skills of 2022</strong></p><p>In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year. Why? Every business can benefit from someone who writes great copy. From startups to Fortune 500s and everything in between, copywriting can make or break the success of an organisation.</p><p>The truth of the matter is this; anyone can become a copywriter. You don\u2019t need a degree or specialised training to master this skill. So, whether you\u2019re looking to start a career as a freelance copywriter or just want to improve the copy for your own business, this guide will give you the blueprint for getting your feet wet with copywriting.</p><p>Copywriting is the art of writing text for marketing purposes. It\u2019s designed to sell your products or services while establishing a voice for your brand. The main intention of copywriting is to persuade people to take a particular action, whether it\u2019s purchasing, signing up for something, or any other type of conversion.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Comes in Many Different Forms: </strong></p><p>Advertisements, web pages, brochures, white papers, social media content, and company tag-lines would all fall into the copywriting category, and that\u2019s just barely scratching the surface.</p><p>But copywriting is much more than just words. Great copy tells a compelling story and represents your brand image. It pulls on the strings that trigger the decision-making process for whoever reads what you\u2019re writing. </p><p>Copywriting doesn\u2019t sell products or services; it sells emotion and lifestyle. According to Google Trends, the global interest in copywriting is currently at an all-time high, based on search data over the last ten years.</p><p><strong>When You Enrol, You Also Get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course materials and tuition worth at least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and free extra resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes - 308 Questions A, B, C, D &amp; 14 Assignments</p></li><li><p>Complete Overview of all 210&nbsp;Google SEO Ranking Factors</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money-back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today</p></li><li><p>PDF Digital Nomad Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Starter pack for digital nomads</p></li><li><p>PDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically</p></li><li><p>PDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients</p></li><li><p>PDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination</p></li><li><p>PDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling</p></li><li><p>PDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value</p></li></ul><p><strong>Start Your Journey to Google SEO &amp; Copywriting Today!</strong></p><p>Digital marketing can turn around your entire financial situation - <em>if </em>you know how to do it right.

Local SEO has a lot in common with normal SEO, but includes the promotion of your location information, which you will need to optimise your strategy around.</p><p>When Google ranks websites for Local SEO, it examines normal SEO ranking factors AND a set of unique Local search factors.

For best results, you must optimise for the Google MAP Pack, get visible on relevant local review sites, and use research tools like Yelp and Google Suggest to select the best keywords to pair with your location word.

Putting aside the excitement of new developments, the convenience that technology may provide is unrivalled. Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It's a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend's Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!! The health and fitness tech business is greatly growing at a breakneck pace, thanks to advances in wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and even mixed reality, making it an exciting time for both customers and developers.</p><p>Oculus stealthily released a fitness tracker called Oculus Move that sits inside its Quest headsets in the final days of 2020. Users who download the software can climb on a ticker hovering above or below their field of view to see how many calories they burn in virtual reality, as well as how many minutes they spend physically active. They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker's dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.</p><p>Apps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of 2022, according to the World Economic Forum. It's a big increase, demonstrating how popular home fitness has become, with hundreds of subscription-based options now accessible. One standout brand has been setting the pace and capitalising on consumer demand called 360 Wellness.&nbsp;360 Wellness is a decentralised and unique live wellness marketplace concept. It's really a robust set of web and mobile applications that connect individuals with health and fitness specialists all over the world. </p><p>Let's now look at what kind of incredible stuff you will be learning in this course titled <strong>\"New-Age Technologies For Fitness Trainers (2022 Edition)\" </strong>that has been created by<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Piyush\".</em></strong></p><p>We will learn that technological advancements continue to have an enormous impact on practically every aspect of our life. People's communication, information seeking, music listening, meal ordering, and shopping habits have all changed as a result of them. We will also discover how technology is creating a huge impact on the fitness businesses and professionals, with even gyms changing how they deliver workout routines. What's more?&nbsp;We will be learning about wearable tech, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;on the fitness industry and unveiling the future of fitness training using the 360 Wellness App. A topic lesson on 3D&nbsp;sports prototypes will ultimately amaze you to the core.
