Learn computer forensics and investigate NEW", "description": "<p><strong>Digital forensics</strong> is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery, investigation, examination and analysis of material found in digital devices, often in relation to mobile devices and computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.</p><p>Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved</p><p>During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.</p><p>Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-10-29_12-04-50-34599e303acc927f09b1035a6997206c/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639829796&Signature=BFRfu3GCLTsXLIIqempUp7KBLWmPpU8QEMwBEUdxP~sBTRLxhSxejRpv9zjUP0Rj6Me5HQpNdsgNOJ3NWlJhlu45AQeOHb3pjnX4n70LE-7gmgS00GrChijYkqpIuIVFQlD4OGPxBuJZQp24LCdOlEtVMG0xbdayxYnRnnzKC-1FcvgYcg1hXzL4C3oWrhdybsZRFfrNwk7ysaIHNV3YHYlhYqbLddlFnwI~Hv4z3buVAwWQVGR8g~zDMMd0AjflV~H-4lR6grZeV3FxD0FDrKYhUP6F1tQRERhCECJmkwHoZDtf1dAHSn6QqVFD4b2sAvxJiGDbXVxFz8HN~ymFxw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3878694", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Other Personal Development", "title": "TOP G1 driver\u2019s license Practice Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "", "rating": "3.6", "reviews": "9", "students": "4888", "coupon_code": "BE9B781F8CA5565F6490", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3878694_f0e8.jpg?secure=wQCFYbl0VyE1vQF3ijgQKQ%3D%3D%2C1639900003", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/top-g1-drivers-license-practice-tests-ontario-canada/?couponCode=BE9B781F8CA5565F6490", "end_day": "2021-12-22 16:50:54+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Most Common Questions for G1 Practice Tests for Ontario and Canadian driver\u2019s license", "description": "<p><strong>G1 Test Practice: Free ON \u201cDrive Test\u201d G1 Practice Test 2021</strong></p><p><strong><em>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our <strong>G1 Practice Test</strong> with multiple choice questions, is intended to help you prepare for the <strong>Ontario G1 practice test</strong> and learners driver\u2019s test that is required before you can get your <strong>Canadian driver\u2019s license</strong>.</p><p>This free practice Written G1 driving test is a lesson that is essential for getting your Ontario driver\u2019s license at your local licensing office.<br>Please note, however, that this is not the actual test, and you will not receive your license if you pass this practice test.</p><p><br></p><p>Our <strong>most popular G1 practice test.</strong> Once you are 16, you may visit a Drive Test location and test for the Ontario G1 license with a written knowledge test of 40 multiple-choice questions. The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam.

Normally in building cloud-native applications microservices-based architecture is used. In this course, I have explained microservices in the simplest possible way. We start with the explanation of traditional architecture such as Monolithic Architecture, then we discuss how it evolved via service-oriented architecture (SOA) to finally microservices architecture. We talk about the benefits and the challenges of these architectures.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we do NOT cover the microservices-based-frameworks or advanced level of design patterns of microservices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who's teaching you in this course?</strong></p><p>I have been working with zekeLabs as a corporate trainer for AWS, Azure, DevOps, Git, Chef, Docker. I had extensive experience in the software industry where I have worked as a senior developer and cloud and DevOps Consultant.

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.</p><p>Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.</p><p>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.</p><p>Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.

Make sure you\u2019re sitting comfortably, as it\u2019s time to see how to put all the information you\u2019ve learned on copywriting into practice\u2026 From your sales pages to your press releases, video scripts, blog post headlines meta descriptions, and email campaigns to your Facebook posts and Press releases, knowing how to create great copy will help your marketing efforts enormously. When you learn how to do it right, you'll be able to get higher conversion rates on key pages, improve the structure of your blogs, get more engagement in social media, and have many more people share your content.</p><p>Most importantly of all, you'll be able to understand your customer\u2019s needs, which will help you connect with your target audience much better. To create truly great copy, you first need to know your audience. You must understand what drives them, their hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears and desires.</p><p>Once you have this knowledge, you'll be able to write copy that immediately connects with the people you're trying to reach, because you'll be speaking their language. This will make all your content 100% more effective, and you'll find it easier to be able to get people to take the action you want. Knowing how to write good copy is an essential marketing skill, that will help you boost your reach, sell more, and get more customer engagement. </p><p><strong>IT WILL ALSO MAKE YOU MUCH MORE EMPLOYABLE, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS, 73% OF EMPLOYERS WANT TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH STRONG WRITING SKILLS.</strong></p><p><strong>GET MAX ATTENTION FROM THE OFF</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use headers that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of headers are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make headers sound more specific: like 10 Top tips to get ripped fast, or 5 PRO ways to protect your privacy online. Don\u2019t just cast out clickbait headers that bear no relation to your content, or people will lose trust in you and switch off.</p><p><strong>DON\u2019T SHY AWAY FROM EMOTION</strong></p><p>While it\u2019s true that dropping stats and facts helps you build trust and credibility, if you do this too much, you\u2019ll end up boring people. Your copy needs a human element to be relatable, and one of the most powerful ways to achieve this is making your content emotional. Use high impact words, and share funny stories, or situations your audience can relate to, so that they can put themselves right in the scenario. When you add an element of personality, you\u2019ll make your followers feel closer to you than to other content creators who play it safe and stick to the facts.</p><p><strong>IDENTIFY YOUR AUDIENCE\u2019S PAIN POINTS</strong></p><p>Pain points are problems people stress about and look for a solution too. Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action. Let your your audience know they must act now<em> </em>if they want the solution.</p><p><strong>LEARN SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p>Because of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a huge competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>WHEN YOU ENROL, YOU ALSO GET:</strong></p><ul><li><p>COURSE MATERIALS AND TUITION Worth AT LEAST $1080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!!</p></li><li><p>23 PRO CONTENT MARKETING TEMPLATES ready for download</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and FREE EXTRA RESOURCES you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes &amp; Assignments</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question ANYTIME</p></li></ul><p><strong>COPYWRITING HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IN-DEMAND SKILLS OF 2022.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</p><p>Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The term <em>Six Sigma</em> originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a <em>sigma</em> rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.</p><p>Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p><p>In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\".</p><p>In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4408498", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "Car Repair - Auto Mechanic Training Masterclass CRTC+ 2021", "level": "All Levels", "author": "OCSALY - Online Computer Science Academy", "duration": "4.5 hours", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "629", "coupon_code": "CARMECHANICFREE", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4408498_f040_2.jpg?secure=zLsn4L1yvslUKmh5xNLjnw%3D%3D%2C1639900210", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/car-repair-auto-mechanic-training-masterclass-crtc-2021/?couponCode=CARMECHANICFREE", "end_day": "2021-12-22 17:36:25+00:00", "headline": "Learn car repair and be Car Mechanic.

It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.</p><p>Most automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.</p><p>The engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive.</p><p>The transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions.</p><p>In cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears.</p><p>The driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads.</p><p>The differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft. It lets the wheels turn at different speeds because in curves the outer wheels must travel a greater distance than the inner ones.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-12-12_18-13-53-7efbd9341ec83f289a7b0e10a1ea8222/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639830010&Signature=jm3dlbTAQesqMO7ol36SIM0f8HGs0qliEhcHrobDLSRd~7s~16OIXJSPnPHtjN-mZH2Gcgcnu40UgMQLqNO~fQyGMIF5p1QGtDfwVG9TqpKV5n~Fg9doA8~AsqvjP2BIdV-AM1CgMrOTlRlKQBKPCOGmXaJrA5rz2NsiwQ8YAUVBNxzChQ4eWIh18tTSfunJGVDtaCt~-dz~ftH3KiyX93dxJll2vwOQ-izBVOfGsJVrdohxAhTuVs6qYIj0Im5vQQKHgkaNXJ1CTU7QUepYsxCrQBqvraEHgrihYqj1CYatr4G2H8sbUJ8dLBsPj5OPFmx6ENB3Xl2XpP5eYVtP0Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3872124", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Other Personal Development", "title": "Australian Citizenship Test  The Dream", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "18", "students": "10765", "coupon_code": "F2964B631283905E6DD7", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3872124_58fa_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/australian-citizenship-test-certificate-the-immigration-dream/?couponCode=F2964B631283905E6DD7", "end_day": "2021-12-22 16:52:35+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Get Ready for Certificate of Australian Citizenship CAC", "description": "<p><strong>Welcome !&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong> </strong><em>get Ready for Certificate of Australian Citizenship CAC</em></p><p>Get ready to say \"I am Australian.\"</p><p><strong><em>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2021 Australian Citizenship Test</strong></p><p>Congratulations on choosing to become an Australian citizen.

Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3877348", "category": "Lifestyle", "sub_category": "Travel", "title": "2022 Commercial Driver\u2019s License Practice Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "11", "students": "6990", "coupon_code": "CAF1A15FC78840073661", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3877348_a5ee_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/trucks-cars-tesla-commercial-drivers-license-practice-tests/?couponCode=CAF1A15FC78840073661", "end_day": "2021-12-22 16:51:19+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Commercial Driver\u2019s License Practice Test", "description": "<p><strong>Commercial Driver\u2019s License Practice Test</strong></p><p><strong><em>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Endorsements on your <strong>Commercial Driver\u2019s License</strong> open you up to many more Truck Job Opportunities. However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4141444", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Self Esteem & Confidence", "title": "Raviver Son Amour De Soi, Son Estime De Soi Et Ses Relations", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Alain W.", "duration": "1,5\u00a0heures", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "2", "students": "547", "coupon_code": "34E49D3E98D7D92E87C4", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4141444_caf9_2.jpg?secure=rgJdti8tA_zYJJzwNe5GCg%3D%3D%2C1639900226", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/booster-son-amour-propre/?couponCode=34E49D3E98D7D92E87C4", "end_day": "2021-12-19 08:54:16+00:00", "headline": "Rallumez son amour de soi, son estime de soi et ravivez ses relations.
