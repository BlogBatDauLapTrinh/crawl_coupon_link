The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

Once this step is complete, the Migration wizard works on the meta-data stored in its repository, instead of issuing queries against your live database.</p><p>Convert Captured Model to Oracle<strong> :</strong> The next step in the migration process is to convert the captured model&nbsp;&nbsp;of the database to an Oracle-specific model.&nbsp;</p><p>Translate Third Party SQL Objects to Oracle :The next step in the migration process is to translate the&nbsp;T-SQL objects - constraints, functions, procedures, triggers, views - to Oracle SQL objects.&nbsp;</p><p>Generating Scripts to Create Target Database<strong> </strong>:Once the conversion process has completed, SQL Developer has&nbsp;a model of what the converted database will look like.

Another coworker, in sales, might mainly use the <strong>Power BI phone app</strong> to monitor progress on sales quotas, and to drill into new sales lead details.</p><p>If you're a developer, you might use Power BI APIs to push data into datasets or to embed dashboards and reports into your own custom applications.

converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called <em>digital representation</em> or, more specifically, a <em>digital image</em>, for the object, and <em>digital form</em>, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitate processing by digital computers and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.</p><p>Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\". Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organizations around the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Haytham H.

Business intelligence tools make this possible by processing large data sets across multiple sources and presenting findings in visual formats that are easy to understand and share.</p><p>There are four keys steps that business intelligence follows to transform raw data into easy-to-digest insights for everyone in the organization to use. The first three\u2014data collection, analysis, and visualization\u2014set the stage for the final decision-making step. Before using BI, businesses had to do much of their analysis manually, but BI tools automate many of the processes and save companies time and effort.</p><p>Step 1: Collect and transform data from multiple sources</p><p>Business intelligence tools typically use the extract, transform, and load (ETL) method to aggregate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. This data is then transformed and remodeled before being stored in a central location, so applications can easily analyze and query it as one comprehensive data set.</p><p>Step 2: Uncover trends and inconsistencies</p><p>Data mining, or data discovery, typically uses automation to quickly analyze data to find patterns and outliers which provide insight into the current state of business. BI tools often feature several types of data modeling and analytics\u2014including exploratory, descriptive, statistical, and predictive\u2014that further explore data, predict trends, and make recommendations.</p><p>Step 3: Use data visualization to present findings</p><p>Business intelligence reporting uses data visualizations to make findings easier to understand and share. Reporting methods include interactive data dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps that help users see what\u2019s going on in the business right now.</p><p>Business intelligence is applied differently from business to business and across a range of sectors\u2014finance, retail and consumer goods, energy, technology, government, education, healthcare, manufacturing, and professional services. Here\u2019s how business intelligence is being used by different industries to achieve success.</p><p>Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.</p><p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p><p>Pandas is an open-source python library that is used for data manipulation and analysis.

Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p><p><strong>Tkinter</strong> is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI&nbsp; Desktop applications</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Java</strong> is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacentres, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere.</p><p>Java applications generally contain many mini programs with various functions. Some mini programs have a graphical user interface (GUI), if only a simple window or dialog box, and many mini programs have no GUI. The application itself, however, is likely to have a main GUI that consists of menus, buttons, tool bars, text fields, and other graphical features. The GUI is mainly for user input, whether the user clicks a button or types in information, and a GUI can provide the user with additional information. In addition, GUI components often display information back to the user.</p><p>To create the GUI, you use the Java Foundation Classes/Swing (JFC/Swing) and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) API. The many classes and interfaces in those packages allow you to easily create buttons, check-box objects, text fields, and other components, as well as components to organize them. By far the easiest way to create the frame and all the GUI components for your application is to use an integrated development environment (IDE),&nbsp; such as the NetBeans IDE. This IDE allows you to drag and drop your components into place while it writes the complex component code for you. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>C#</strong> (pronounced \"See Sharp\") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now involved in the creation of smart video and has also been able to influence businesses. Users can now film and edit videos through Artificial Intelligence. It also brings many job opportunities in the field. Due to its ability to sense, reason, act and adapt, AI has suddenly become one of the most important technologies and the most in-demand tool for the video creation market; and also due to the popularity of automation in different business practices. Several companies have invested in keeping video production as their main target in Artificial Intelligence. Examples include AI implementation and deployment through multiple video distribution channels such as Netflix and YouTube. These companies have invested in AI just to make it more exciting and innovative to watch videos. Many aspects of the production and editing process of videos have been handled by artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Its innovation is also a blessing for production teams and video editors. It helps practitioners to concentrate more on creative aspects instead of editing which is perceived by many to be a very dull and repetitive job.</p><p><em>Did you also know this fact?</em></p><p>Most aspects of the production and distribution system are managed by artificial intelligence. It can now record, edit, pick and distribute online videos. Artificial intelligence has allowed automated video editing in 2021. A camera can now operate on its own without human instructions.&nbsp;Ok, so what does this&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Video&nbsp;Creation course cover?&nbsp;Let's look into this further.&nbsp;Here is the ultimate question. </p><p><strong><em>Why learn this mind-blowing course and how this can be a differentiator when it comes to AI&nbsp;video creation?</em></strong></p><p>With Biteable,&nbsp;you can convert any plain infographic into fun slides that will not only explain and pass the information but also make the content more understandable.

An 8th grader can do it. </p><p>The question is <strong>\"Are you ready to get into the video-making action, right now?\" </strong></p><p><strong>2021 seems to be a great and amazing year to take your video creation efforts to great heights of success.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-08-15_10-02-05-9001f5782f12f6890128a2fb0f34b41e/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637878169&Signature=jdaMd78dJtyLQ9kJxlS9h3InEyfP~uUsqz04qRPswNp3vA3yOl4f0LZDodk1hVlWQPZUpJcNmAMTck2DbERBn1u42gUBc~cGdlwch6tIimvUZL029-GQ7KymQJT7PwMNlJ3AHuF4yr2m~Vy~5b8PIHnbeg7wvPISUbcUgeNQ1PxlHu36JY1stSe4qKYHBSa8fm4gVD25wEmZ-ChHdUYz27BPWXCLbraUf0xHoZsO2cftbFJSuOzRljVzZFK-Oo9VLPeQ8-mC-XArW2ZT29lVWCTMGawa591IVRXYzY6EIIa7lhcb27YiaAY-cLUz6kSqZm-oxA8zkdDqHSi-yvcWgA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}]}
