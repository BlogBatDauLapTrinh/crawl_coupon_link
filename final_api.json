If you're willing to learn and apply the knowledge I share with you,<em> I</em> can teach you the rest.</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm interested, so what will I learn exactly?</strong></p><p>First, you\u2019ll get a comprehensive, high quality video overview that will show you how to CREATE FACEBOOK ADS THAT DELIVER REAL RESULTS. I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover the customer journey to purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find your IDEAL customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to HONE IN ON YOUR PERFECT CUSTOMER. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be sharing POWERFUL INSIDER TARGETING STRATEGIES that will SUPERPOWER your custom and lookalike audience set up.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting the most out of the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and FAST.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events to take your Ad game to the next level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to GET MORE from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Facebook Ads Reporting and Attributions</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll show you how to use Facebook Reporting to create interactive weekly email reports on all your Facebook Ad campaigns. This will help you see how all your Facebook Ads are performing and where your Ad spend is going.</p><p>This is invaluable information as you'll be able to funnel your ad spend to where it returns you the best investment. It also helps you identify weak areas, so you can see where you might be going wrong, and where you can improve.</p><p>You\u2019ll also learn how to harness the power of Facebook Attributions, so you can use data driven tracking models to understand browser\u2019s interaction with your ads, across multiple platforms.</p><p>Facebook attributions let you gain a greater insight into the customer journey to purchase. This is an awesome tool for any advertiser, as it enables you to measure the incremental impact of each of your ads in your customer\u2019s path to conversion.</p><p><em>WAIT THAT'S NOT ALL\u2026</em></p><p>You'll also be getting some amazing bonuses that will really help you to TAKE YOUR MARKETING GAME TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</p><p><strong>Convert more, sell FASTER</strong></p><p>You'll receive my EXCLUSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR MAXIMISING YOUR AD CONVERSION RATE ON FACEBOOK.</p><p>Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages. I'll be sharing what these are, and how you can easily implement them in my course.</p><p><strong>Create compelling AD COPY THAT SELLS</strong></p><p>You'll also get a comprehensive QUICK START GUIDE TO COPYWRITING MASTERY, so you can create copy that engages right off the bat.

I started with Amazon's free self-study video series, but there is no way that the information contained in that series would have been enough. I also purchased a video course provided via Udemy, it was very helpful in filling in some details about the terminology in services that AWS offers, it still wouldn't have been enough. These practice exams are exactly what I needed.</p><p>These practice exams are worded very similarly to what you'll see on the exams, but are not verbatim. In fact, I found the that way these questions are worded lead me to learn more about the technology areas that the exam focuses on, helping ensure a positive result.</p><p>Also, and this is very important. The instructor(?) is very active in the Q&amp;A area. S/He responds quickly to questions, and provides clear answers, often with links to the material that supports the answer.</p><p>This is the practice exam series you want!</p><p>Tracy Norrell</p><p><br></p><p>\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Yesterday, I passed this exam on my first attempt. This is a great course to pass the cloud practitioner exam. Highly recommended to all. I noticed that all the questions were in the exam was totally covered in this course. Without this material I won't be able to pass my exam. Thank you so much. Waiting for CSA Practice test.</p><p>Maulik Patel</p><p><br></p><p>\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b501. Buy this course 2 -3 weeks before your AWS-CCP exam. 2. Take one, 65-question quiz every other day. 3. Pass or fail, review your results, read (and research) the explanations. Watch your scores dramatically improve. 4. Repeat the exam/review/retake cycle six times (6-exams) leading up to your proctored exams. 5. You WILL pass the CCP.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</p><p>Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The term <em>Six Sigma</em> originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a <em>sigma</em> rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.</p><p>Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p><p>In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\".</p><p>In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2769396", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Microsoft", "title": "Microsoft Teams Ultimate Course 2021", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "5 hours", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "841", "students": "93526", "coupon_code": "TRY1000FREE122102", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2769396_b847_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-microsoft-teams/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE122102", "end_day": "2021-12-16 11:02:54+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Microsoft Teams", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn Microsoft Teams but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to create Teams and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then Microsoft Teams 2021 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Microsoft Teams is an in-demand skill in 2021. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start creating Teams like an expert with Microsoft Teams.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of Microsoft Teams. </p><p>This is great for students starting or for IT Personal that need a refresher course on Microsoft Teams.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 5 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p>Here's What You'll Learn:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.
