Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now involved in the creation of smart video and has also been able to influence businesses. Users can now film and edit videos through Artificial Intelligence. It also brings many job opportunities in the field. Due to its ability to sense, reason, act and adapt, AI has suddenly become one of the most important technologies and the most in-demand tool for the video creation market; and also due to the popularity of automation in different business practices. Several companies have invested in keeping video production as their main target in Artificial Intelligence. Examples include AI implementation and deployment through multiple video distribution channels such as Netflix and YouTube. These companies have invested in AI just to make it more exciting and innovative to watch videos. Many aspects of the production and editing process of videos have been handled by artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Its innovation is also a blessing for production teams and video editors. It helps practitioners to concentrate more on creative aspects instead of editing which is perceived by many to be a very dull and repetitive job.</p><p><em>Did you also know this fact?</em></p><p>Most aspects of the production and distribution system are managed by artificial intelligence. It can now record, edit, pick and distribute online videos. Artificial intelligence has allowed automated video editing in 2021. A camera can now operate on its own without human instructions.&nbsp;Ok, so what does this&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Video&nbsp;Creation course cover?&nbsp;Let's look into this further.&nbsp;Here is the ultimate question. </p><p><strong><em>Why learn this mind-blowing course and how this can be a differentiator when it comes to AI&nbsp;video creation?</em></strong></p><p>With Biteable,&nbsp;you can convert any plain infographic into fun slides that will not only explain and pass the information but also make the content more understandable.

Also, you will find a document with extra exercises in each lesson.</p><p><strong>SPEAK</strong></p><p>You will learn Spanish by repetition, therefore, <strong>REPEAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE</strong>. Repetition is very important to transfer new words learned from the short-term memory to the long-term memory. Once you transfer the new sentences in the long-term, it will be harder to forget them.</p><p><strong>THE COURSE</strong></p><p>The course has a duration of 3.5 hours approximately in which you will learn the basic of the Spanish language. Each lesson has a duration of approximately 10-15 minutes. After doing the course you will feel confident to speak Spanish in different situations. Travelling to Spain or Latin America will not be the same again. You will be able to interact with native speakers.</p><p><strong>ENJOY LEARNING</strong></p><p>Muchas gracias</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-04-24_11-17-16-835245dcfb7a252c5a99aba521d973cc/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639326397&Signature=SOwmwC3S9lStiHNXs9u7JZqrb~xWOqNT-m058xuafnwMC6s2zWFT34AVUjqE7LrqWxDMVFdMLLJpX7SKkJjbIUBMxQMJEgecQFXYPKQCIbAUquZnRTfGKv~nE~qBg6EXfslIbe2eUEzo6-HpsHtRQAAhs09EYHeqTFVqORBGG~O60SSJdrO5UXI0Qxfn23og8sxSAuLlriGZO5VL2tlD6KwsRof81hEmKjQZDjEroncEScZH2ZB3aRUGb6Hpi-V5~S-dmiSRKnPGVOwvRwwGV6yn1~K~heuXYDuOMQ~Sq09VWHqp~QSuO7EvSBBbahIPltBswjH09uJQ-LQp825i3A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2904819", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Modern Niche Marketing: Niche Website for Beginners!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "OMG - Mastermind", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "188", "students": "44190", "coupon_code": "3CC4DDBA59C45ADAE197", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2904819_ab4b_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-niche-marketing-niche-website-for-beginners/?couponCode=3CC4DDBA59C45ADAE197", "end_day": "2021-12-16 03:12:26+00:00", "headline": "Discover Niche Marketing In The Modern World.

Before the modern information age creativity was not something the average person really needed in order to be a productive member of society. In the 19th and most of the 20th century all or most people needed was the ability to follow instructions well. Being creative was reserved for a small educated elite and artists of various types.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.

The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.</p><p>One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it. The ability to use it to improve digital marketing strategies and valuable customer insights for companies will be the same as it continues to advance. Excellent customer service is the also most important aspect of an effective digital marketing campaign that this too can be automated by Google Duplex kind of tools that are created in the market.</p><p>Why this secretive course in <strong>\"Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing -&nbsp;Gold Edition\" </strong>- the best one in the industry?</p><p>Artificial intelligence keeps growing and improving and will not slow down for a while. Implementing AI into your digital marketing strategy will help customers experience better and provide your business with the insights it needs to succeed.</p><p>What\u2019s more? The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model. </p></li><li><p><strong>Part 3 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python and R</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>We also understand the importance of libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow in this part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 4 - Data Preprocessing</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn what actions you need to take to prepare Data for the analysis, these steps are very important for creating a meaningful.</p><p>In this section, we will start with the basic theory of decision tree then we cover data pre-processing topics like<strong>&nbsp; </strong>missing value imputation, variable transformation and Test-Train split.<strong> </strong></p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a Neural Network model in Python will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use ANN to create predictive models and solve business problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below are some popular FAQs of students who want to start their Deep learning journey-</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use Python for Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Deep Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Deep Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-03-10_10-59-27-95b1e5c9c707bc992ee87eb9e8fd370a/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639326468&Signature=bSm8NdhB15hsgSm2H2O~h3DIX5xxrvNl70fcqy8boRitwtXKu-SjQS4ohgapgIOfuAp8Ge8nHGCkBYnND2BPhvzj3MxlDRvVVmVADiG0IbbLMEKtVTi0F964Be3DFzoZK54r4CVDd~LPSIA1TzejZ5GviUr~F-nkqu3mLIq8fAaZAkdw7NtbWbKbirbmqSKz~TLhzVu1JWWWXNzjFJSs1nV9c4NSGT3mpm4EX3sFzeJZY8Q1lnahW5pRAb1zVNQ5tOw7kGkZvJTll3TzXGD1arhOvi3FjiD~wdIsJONdoWIy4LxW5wTqOE7WQBHq3mS1tIf3f8l77kERw~d6zz5teQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3716766", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Project Management: Cost & Schedule Monitoring using EVM", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Akhil Krishna", "duration": "33 mins", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "589", "students": "69609", "coupon_code": "EVMDEC", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3716766_e7d8_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/earned-value-management-technique-with-examples/?couponCode=EVMDEC", "end_day": "2021-12-16 12:13:06+00:00", "headline": "Earned Value Management, Project Management, Cost Control & Monitor, Budget, Schedule & Cost Variance, Performance Index", "description": "<p>The course will help you understand the basic concepts of Earned Value Management which is one of the most important technique for effective Project Management.</p><p>By the end of this course you will learn the key terms of Earned Value Management, their definitions and the various formulas used to analyze whether the project is getting executed on track with respect to cost and schedule.</p><p>The course lets you understand the concept of Budget, Planned Value, Earned Value.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</p><p>Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The term <em>Six Sigma</em> originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a <em>sigma</em> rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.</p><p>Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p><p>In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\".</p><p>In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}]}
