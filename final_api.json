You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

Make sure you\u2019re sitting comfortably, as it\u2019s time to see how to put all the information you\u2019ve learned on copywriting into practice\u2026 From your sales pages to your press releases, video scripts, blog post headlines meta descriptions, and email campaigns to your Facebook posts and Press releases, knowing how to create great copy will help your marketing efforts enormously. When you learn how to do it right, you'll be able to get higher conversion rates on key pages, improve the structure of your blogs, get more engagement in social media, and have many more people share your content.</p><p>Most importantly of all, you'll be able to understand your customer\u2019s needs, which will help you connect with your target audience much better. To create truly great copy, you first need to know your audience. You must understand what drives them, their hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears and desires.</p><p>Once you have this knowledge, you'll be able to write copy that immediately connects with the people you're trying to reach, because you'll be speaking their language. This will make all your content 100% more effective, and you'll find it easier to be able to get people to take the action you want. Knowing how to write good copy is an essential marketing skill, that will help you boost your reach, sell more, and get more customer engagement. </p><p><strong>IT WILL ALSO MAKE YOU MUCH MORE EMPLOYABLE, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS, 73% OF EMPLOYERS WANT TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH STRONG WRITING SKILLS.</strong></p><p><strong>GET MAX ATTENTION FROM THE OFF</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use headers that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of headers are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make headers sound more specific: like 10 Top tips to get ripped fast, or 5 PRO ways to protect your privacy online. Don\u2019t just cast out clickbait headers that bear no relation to your content, or people will lose trust in you and switch off.</p><p><strong>DON\u2019T SHY AWAY FROM EMOTION</strong></p><p>While it\u2019s true that dropping stats and facts helps you build trust and credibility, if you do this too much, you\u2019ll end up boring people. Your copy needs a human element to be relatable, and one of the most powerful ways to achieve this is making your content emotional. Use high impact words, and share funny stories, or situations your audience can relate to, so that they can put themselves right in the scenario. When you add an element of personality, you\u2019ll make your followers feel closer to you than to other content creators who play it safe and stick to the facts.</p><p><strong>IDENTIFY YOUR AUDIENCE\u2019S PAIN POINTS</strong></p><p>Pain points are problems people stress about and look for a solution too. Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action. Let your your audience know they must act now<em> </em>if they want the solution.</p><p><strong>LEARN SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p>Because of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively.

Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</p><p>Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a <em>pallavi</em>, an <em>anupallavi</em>, <em>muktaayi swaras</em>, a <em>charanam</em>, and <em>chittaswaras</em>. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).</p><p>Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.</p><p><strong>Types of varnams</strong></p><p>Named for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, <em>tana varnams</em> only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.</p><p>With rhythmic elements like a padam, <em>pada varnams</em> are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the <em>tana varnam</em> which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a <em>pada varnam</em> also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, <em>pada varnams</em> contain more lyrical content than a <em>tana varnam</em>.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.<em>Padajathi varnams</em> are simply <em>pada varnams</em> that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.</p><p><strong>Contents of a varnam</strong></p><p>The name \"varnam\" (meaning \"letter\") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.</p><p>Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.</p><p>The varnam is subdivided into several sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pallavi</strong>: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anupallavi</strong>: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muktaayi</strong>: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like <em>s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one</em>). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charanam</strong>: Sung with lyrics</p></li><li><p><strong>Chitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram</strong>: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anubandham</strong>: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.</p></li></ul><p>Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.</p><p>Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, <em>Adi Tala</em> (8 beat cycle) and <em>Ata Tala</em> (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the <em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice</p><p><strong>Famous varnams</strong></p><p><em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams include :</p><ul><li><p>\"Sami Ninne\" in <em>Shree ragam</em> composed by <em>Karur Devudu Iyer</em> in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Ninnukori\" in <em>Mohanam ragam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Evvari Bodhana\" in <em>Abhogi ragam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Era Naapai\" in <em>Todi raagam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Valachi Vacchi\" in <em>Navaraagamalika</em> in Telugu (9 ragas, similar to <em>Ragamalika</em> which literally translates to a <em>garland of ragams</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Ata Tala</em> Varnams include:</p><ul><li><p>\"Viriboni\" in <em>Bhairavi ragam</em> by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Nera Nammiti\" in <em>Kaanada raagam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Chalamela\" in <em>Sankarabharanam</em> by Swati Tirunal in Telugu</p></li></ul><p>The <em>Arabhi</em> ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.</p><p>The \"Mathe Malayadhwaja\" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancers</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-10-07_14-34-01-cb6fa294290f4137dc71c52dde409964/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=f--PEzCAbnbUFE_92JryhA%3D%3D%2C1637307692"}, {"course_id": "2955276", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Deep Web- The complete Introduction to the hidden web", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Yassin Marco", "duration": "2.5 hours", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "2564", "students": "204151", "coupon_code": "8DC8E3E5BE8F49EAA13E", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2955276_28ec_2.jpg?secure=AXN4AGkPzkgen6sInVyN9A%3D%3D%2C1637377905", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-introduction-to-the-deep-web/?couponCode=8DC8E3E5BE8F49EAA13E", "end_day": "2021-11-23 21:29:52+00:00", "headline": "learn to navigate on the deep web on a daily basis", "description": "<p>Have you heard many times about the deep/dark web but you never knew what it is.

This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637307722&Signature=egVLpjtZkhZSdGtpKC6H6KUt0772r73lqtPhkRPD4sI0CTTGoGih0p5TyICmCA9S0N~XvuqpsTlbnQpDX0oxS1x8NiLtckY0h1vRAOWshHsKSG23o1hcyWOtfEObHuQck9Gru~QZ52Q8sqa77PbNgEvOcMoQPmJWaYccho2ms3p3Ll76-1ejhV4Ji~TTLEhReqoRJDF3H-idq~uInIKzPh6tg8xJX73Vhktqpq~Loo9IRomFwsJTgKYC0sQ3XeWO7L1yYltk2H9bUFMezvB4CgiaNaO3dUGmEr6-cQlh5ioFRPK~eluyNMhQ48PHAGDI-NRNNhto4gGftphF48WqMA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2741282", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Management", "title": "Best Leadership & Management Training Course", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Prof. Paul Cline, Ed.D", "duration": "2.5 hours", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "237", "students": "29313", "coupon_code": "6775D23CA09ADED3F552", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2741282_723e.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/best-leadership-management-training-course/?couponCode=6775D23CA09ADED3F552", "end_day": "2021-11-23 15:16:02+00:00", "headline": "Discover The Hidden Secrets Of Great Leaders & Managers", "description": "<p>In This Online Training Course You Will Learn About The Leadership &amp; Management Challenges Facing Companies \u2026 That Can Make Or Break Their Businesses.</p><p>In This Leadership &amp; Management Training Course You Will Discover Specific Tools, Strategies And Techniques To BEAT These Challenges.

With the new skills you\u2019ll learn from us, you\u2019ll master the essentials of Digital Marketing, which will open up a whole new world of online success and career opportunities.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS DIGITAL MARKETING?</strong></p><p>Digital marketing is vital if you have a business or want to sell anything online. Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.</p><p>Just like traditional marketing, digital marketing, is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time. Digital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you had invested in a print ad.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS SOCIAL MEDIA?</strong></p><p>Social Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most of there is content produced being from the users not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn. </p><p>Due to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now essential for anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS SEO?</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.</p><p>SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p><strong>WHEN YOU ENROL, YOU CAN USE AND CUSTOMISE OUR 23 CONTENT MARKETING TEMPLATES</strong></p><p>This how to Content Marketing, Social Media &amp; SEO guide contains every essential type of example you\u2019ll ever need to empower your business:</p><ol><li><p>Facebook Ad Template 1</p></li><li><p>Facebook Ad Template 2</p></li><li><p>Landing Page Template</p></li><li><p>Mini Story Email</p></li><li><p>Email Teaser</p></li><li><p>Email Welcome Template</p></li><li><p>Sales Letter Template</p></li><li><p>The Detailed Listicle (Blogging)</p></li><li><p>The Product Comparison (Blogging)</p></li><li><p>The How-to Comprehensive Guide (Blogging)</p></li><li><p>Guest Blog Outreach Template</p></li><li><p>LinkedIn Ad Template</p></li><li><p>Outreach template for LinkedIn</p></li><li><p>Twitter Ad Template</p></li><li><p>Twitter Post Template</p></li><li><p>YouTube Video Description Template</p></li><li><p>Instagram Post Template</p></li><li><p>Instagram Ad Template</p></li><li><p>Press Release Template</p></li><li><p>Influencer Outreach Template</p></li><li><p>Backlink Outreach Template 1</p></li><li><p>Backlink Outreach Template 2</p></li><li><p>Template to ask for Social Shares from Influencers</p></li></ol><p>You\u2019ll see what you need to do - and why - and can tweak our practical samples so they suit your own needs exactly.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2019-06-18_12-59-58-03caeadbd0fd28015868d7836c8261f8/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637307827&Signature=B-jSquYga1qwImDRX~qnVhFMUvCPUuaculhLZ5FH8WJ7Wfx~mIT-UGuJ3vP5WVMx~tFo9pj9uALmwibLvAe8LWXDLB~OoIQfK6v9nNNGXvDie1ZMYzR3KU4oBPX6KhotgTz5yopgJAGbNiEXx50WAgL8acD-1B-Za-m6Skcf~zeaDl22ArlwjBTVYMVOkezWrgfd8t4vyKXPirwBr3cAkpZP1BbNHqQ5X8nozhApAlhnjj8nY5gvbSAhII4vmbBNijCwDWMyLF4ScxR95yaWYgjpes0C0lDs9RdYA6dazsF5ujirXSdS-Gn4bqcxZnaIX0pvainGth8Td3GqizWVgw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3833504", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Data Science", "title": "Machine Learning Real World projects in Python", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Shan Singh", "duration": "11.5 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "607", "students": "70969", "coupon_code": "BLACK_FRIDAY", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3833504_fe47.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-real-world-projects-in-python/?couponCode=BLACK_FRIDAY", "end_day": "2021-11-23 21:48:34+00:00", "headline": "Build 3 Practical Real World Projects and become a master in Machine Learning", "description": "<p> Machine Learning is one of the hottest technology field in the world right now!

That\u2019s not true. The basics of SEO are actually quite simple. And with 58% of all web traffic coming from Google, it\u2019s certainly something worth learning about if you have a website. If you think the SEO fundamentals aren\u2019t enough to get you ranked, think again. Most people running websites have a very limited understanding of SEO, so knowing the fundamentals can certainly help you succeed.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of SEO?</strong></p><ul><li><p>SEO leads to more traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to consistent traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to \u2018free\u2019 traffic</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO helps you to rank higher,</strong> but you can\u2019t rank higher if Google doesn\u2019t even know your website exists in the first place. Getting your website indexed by search engines means you\u2019re in the race, not that you\u2019re likely to win. That\u2019s where SEO comes in. SEO is an ongoing process that, if done well, increases your chances of winning over time. It\u2019s much easier to do SEO well when your website is properly set up for SEO success.</p><p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business. And that content needs to reach audience members in a way that feels natural and organic versus being disruptive. Content marketing helps businesses do this, and it describes the process of attracting, engaging with, and delighting your target markets.</p><p><strong>By honing in on effective content marketing, you can do just that \u2014 and as a result, increase conversions, improve brand awareness, boost revenue, establish yourself as an industry leader, and more.</strong></p><p>Content marketing is the process of planning, creating, distributing, sharing, and publishing content to reach your target audience. It can boost factors like brand awareness, sales, reach, interactions, and loyalty.</p><ul><li><p>Educate your leads and prospects about the products and services you offer</p></li><li><p>Boost conversions</p></li><li><p>Build relationships between your customers and business that result in increased loyalty</p></li><li><p>Show your audience how your products and services solve their challenges</p></li><li><p>Create a sense of community around your brand</p></li></ul><p><strong>Copywriting has become one of the most in-demand skills of 2022. In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year.</strong> Why? Every business can benefit from someone who writes great copy. From startups to Fortune 500s and everything in between, copywriting can make or break the success of an organisation.</p><p>The truth of the matter is this; anyone can become a copywriter. You don\u2019t need a degree or specialised training to master this skill. So, whether you\u2019re looking to start a career as a freelance copywriter or just want to improve the copy for your own business, this guide will give you the blueprint for getting your feet wet with copywriting.</p><p><strong>Copywriting is the art of writing text for marketing purposes.</strong> It\u2019s designed to sell your products or services while establishing a voice for your brand. The main intention of copywriting is to persuade people to take a particular action, whether it\u2019s purchasing, signing up for something, or any other type of conversion.</p><p><strong>Copywriting comes in many different forms\u2014advertisements, web pages, brochures, white papers, social media content, and company tag-lines would all fall into the copywriting category, and that\u2019s just barely scratching the surface.</strong></p><p>But copywriting is much more than just words. Great copy tells a compelling story and represents your brand image. It pulls on the strings that trigger the decision-making process for whoever reads what you\u2019re writing. </p><p>Copywriting doesn\u2019t sell products or services; it sells emotion and lifestyle. According to Google Trends, the global interest in copywriting is currently at an all-time high, based on search data over the last ten years.</p><p><strong>When you enrol, you also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>COURSE MATERIALS AND TUITION Worth AT LEAST $2700 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!</p></li><li><p>23 CONTENT MARKETING TEMPLATES you can easily customise for your business</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and FREE EXTRA RESOURCES you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Interactive quizzes &amp; Assignments</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question ANYTIME</p></li></ul><p><strong>I wish you every success and can't wait to welcome you on board,</strong></p><p>Ing.
