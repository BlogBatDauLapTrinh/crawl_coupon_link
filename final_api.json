Most entrepreneurs focus on money too quickly. But startups must focus on growth, which is why identifying the most important growth and engagement metrics is the most important part of starting an innovative new company.&nbsp; </p><p>When you are working on a true innovation, many aspects of your product business are unknown. That's why it's an innovation. If it was a common business that has been done many times before, your KPIs would be known. But since your startup is building something new, you have to identify the right things to focus on in order to grow the most vital parts of your startup.</p><p><strong>HOW&nbsp;THIS COURSE&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;HELP&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;PERFECT YOUR&nbsp;INNOVATION&nbsp;OR&nbsp;TECHNOLOGY </strong></p><p>Any technology from something simple like a hammer to something complicated like spaceships or computers undergo a series of improvements over time until they get to a desired level of use and quality. No innovation is ideal on its first version so the goal of startup entrepreneurs is to create enough iterations of improvement quickly in order to perfect their product.</p><p>The strategy of this course is to show you how to choose the right things to improve so every one of your improvement iterations makes an impact and helps you grow your startup. The way to choose which features of your startup or innovation to improve is to look at use data, analytics, and identify the right KPIs in order to improve the aspects of your startup that are most vital.</p><p>The flip side of this is that if you choose the wrong features to improve, it won't make an impact and your innovation or startup won't grow. This course will help you succeed by using time-proven, best strategies to help you grow your startup and improve your product or innovation.</p><p><strong>UPDATED&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;2022</strong></p><p>Everything in the course is up-to-date for this year.</p><p><strong>ALL TOOLS&nbsp;SHOWN&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE ARE&nbsp;FREE</strong></p><p>All the tools in the course like Google Analytics are free and standard tools used by startups.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2870128", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Other Office Productivity", "title": "QuickBooks Online Not for Profit Organization", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "10 hours", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "39", "students": "14540", "coupon_code": "FF4D558E202EA0D116E3", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2870128_3707.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-online-not-for-profit-organization/?couponCode=FF4D558E202EA0D116E3", "end_day": "2022-01-14 05:39:29+00:00", "headline": "Learn Not for Profit accounting using QuickBooks Online from a practicing CPA", "description": "<p>Learners will understand how to set up QuickBooks Online for a Not for Profit Organization.</p><p>The course will show how to use free resources to optimize learning.</p><p>We will demonstrate the use of class tracking to generate Not for Profit reports.</p><p>Learners will see how to create and use donation receipt forms.</p><p>We will show how to create and use pledge receipt forms.</p><p>The course will demonstrate how to enter and track restricted resources.</p><p>We will enter month end adjusting entries.</p><p>Learners will see how to allocate expenses to programs and administrative categories.</p><p>We will record net assets released from restriction.</p><p>The course will show how to generate, analyze, memorize, &amp; export to Excel financial reports.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-03-14_04-38-58-ec562b174ba95f5be3ba38f35bebf626/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1641757742&Signature=atk~hHJ9yqMEO64oOHZdomfetQyk7mcRaJ5qHBya0Edyosdq3Mv4jQmUW4YcCYOkAM6LltwmFBaqCYD~AAn9Oag56pQKXNsSZeJqPzxnP6wp75YSMUlFqtwCB-eFtDLHHWOt1AmrZ0DmZVUHulYGriqC-01zJTsVTUUf7aqGoDa2oazs9mY7i2VIoXg4sjcg26vb9rSmuqaSWts9f7U3eLISHh3bIGD9qjkd17cMH1j75G3n9i1-Z-2Zl8T7glxqN9fan9MQA8~mwV~KGYDvC4gRNGPXganxP9P7b992ALxYeAYVJJVw0DH1K8W8d3iK~FLRhM1tzt3n6hzA6AWaiQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4482016", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect LV1 Practice Exams", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Edu Academy", "duration": "", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "23", "coupon_code": "DISCUDEMY.COM", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4482016_7229.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/mulesoft-certified-integration-architect-lv1-practice-exams/?couponCode=DISCUDEMY.COM", "end_day": "2022-01-14 15:00:39+00:00", "headline": "2 unique complete tests for MCIA Level 1 Exam with references | Pass MCIA with confidence!", "description": "<p>A <em>MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect</em> should be able to drive and be responsible for an organization\u2019s Anypoint Platform implementation and the technical quality, governance (ensuring compliance), and operationalization of the integration solutions.

When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-09-15_01-25-06-3a8c355b7d04a65d32a35037dbca4675/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1641757767&Signature=UFcTuoX5IPDbyMu4QJJpPeL57FcGvIGaW0qVJI-1ZQjBZEcfxO1om7ONJMUGwnWzrnmV~uqsRv-h-x0BLd-bemAlGTxamz-J4G1vHvpzPBl6O6umFcKfBTJqvdRU6tUWKS82S6kc2a1KKfmmDGnteuLtWqEINu6TXmChBsNHjzPsfGPr8Hs9XBqYzJOScTrQCDK9xateubXt6liWW~4W5f9qGU2eWUsGi9HD4WRuOmdKsqe9lFtlDgi~PBqRX6YKtuuHI~ZE7nbTfgwEc5b~Y~pUuvWB8qMrKSW0r1b1-OEQPO63JrlpljAxtTVs2~jGYaSc-6C9gECnrCkzazaO-Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3518698", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Programming Languages", "title": "Python Demonstrations For Practice Course", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Horizon Tech", "duration": "5.5 hours", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "415", "students": "109595", "coupon_code": "D4F871A9D38FFB891DDF", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3518698_0aff.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-beginners-demonstration-course/?couponCode=D4F871A9D38FFB891DDF", "end_day": "2022-01-14 01:33:03+00:00", "headline": "This course is a depth introduction to fundamental python programming concepts by demonstrations in Python programming .", "description": "<p><strong><em>Learn Python From Beginner To Advanced Level By Demonstrations</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>The course is created thorough, extensive, but easy to follow content which you\u2019ll easily understand and absorb.</p><p> The course starts with the basics, including Python fundamentals, programming, and user interaction.</p><p><br></p><p>The curriculum is going to be very hands-on as we walk you from start to finish becoming a professional Python developer.

Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements.

Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform. You have many tools at your disposal and this course covers that arsenal.

It was designed to be quick, practical and goal-oriented and to provide people with long-term skills to keep them healthy. The focus of cbt is on the problems that come up in a person\u2019s day-to-day life. cbt helps people to look at how they interpret and evaluate what is happening around them and the effects these perceptions have on their emotional experience.</p><p>Childhood experiences and events, while not the focus of cbt, may also be reviewed. This review can help people to understand and address emotional upset that emerged early in life, and to learn how these experiences may influence current responses to events</p><p>According to cbt, the way people feel is linked to the way they think about a situation and not simply to the nature of the situation itself</p><p>In cbt, you learn to identify, question and change the thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and assumptions related to your problematic emotional and behavioural reactions to certain kinds of situations.</p><p>By monitoring and recording your thoughts during situations that lead to emotional upset, you learn that the way you think can contribute to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. In cbt, you learn to reduce these emotional problems by: \u2022 identifying distortions in your thinking \u2022 seeing thoughts as ideas about what is going on rather than as facts \u2022 \u201cstanding back\u201d from your thinking to consider situations from different viewpoints</p><p>For cbt to be effective, you must be open and willing to discuss your thoughts, beliefs and behaviours and to participate in exercises during sessions. For best results, you must also be willing to do homework between sessions.</p><p>CBT is an effective treatment for many psychological conditions. These include: \u2022 mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder \u2022 anxiety disorders, including specific phobias (fear of animals, heights, enclosed spaces), panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder \u2022 bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder \u2022 body dysmorphic disorder (body image) \u2022 substance use disorders ( smoking, alcohol and other drugs).</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-12-31_08-26-44-b55186720cc70cf25965df1e6e1eeb4a/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=z2YoelvWSZYb7aTu3hH05w%3D%3D%2C1641757846"}, {"course_id": "3904774", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Human Resources", "title": "Diversity At Workplace", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nevcihan Dogan", "duration": "32 mins", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "171", "students": "29226", "coupon_code": "JAN-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3904774_476b.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/diversity-at-workplace-t/?couponCode=JAN-2022", "end_day": "2022-01-13 17:24:27+00:00", "headline": "If you want to position your business for success, hire a diverse workforce.", "description": "<p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> is vital for employees because it manifests itself in building a great reputation for the company, leading to increased profitability and opportunities for workers.</p><p>Workplace diversity is important within the organization as well as outside.</p><p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> means that a company\u2019s workforce includes people of varying gender, age, religion, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, languages, education, abilities, etc.</p><p><strong>Why is workplace diversity so important?</strong></p><p>In the modern, globally connected society and market, workplace diversity is becoming a <strong>necessity </strong>rather than a banner companies wave to show their commitment to embracing differences.</p><p>Most of the modern companies can sell their products <strong>all over the world</strong>, reaching many different groups of people.

So, if you want to create an unforgettable first impression, it is very important that you prepare yourself with the correct tools and techniques before you even go to meet the person in question whom you want to impress or go to the event/interview.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked this one question to the many decision-makers all over the world \"If you would like to see the change that will make your organization more productive, what would it be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody came back with one word and they said ATTITUDE. If people had a better disposition, they would have better team coordination, quality would go up, the bottom line would go up, and obviously, success is bound to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that 85% of the time a person gets a job or a promotion is because of the disposition? ONLY 15% depends on how intelligent they are or how many facts and figures they know.</p><p><br></p><p>And almost 100% of the education dollars go to teach facts and figures which accounts for only 15% of the success, and what we are talking about in this course is 85%. This is what brings us to a point that it is not our position but our disposition that determines our success.</p><p>Now, once you are standing in front of the person you want to impress, you want to make sure that you connect with them on a personal as well as on a professional level. Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.

If you have a PC, we'll download for free Power BI Desktop, and look at the various processes which you can use on the Power BI Desktop. Then, we'll look at the Power BI Service (available through any modern web browser), see what you can do with this, and how they compare.</p><p>We'll then look at <strong>Power Apps</strong>. We'll get a free Developer edition and or free trial of Power Apps, and get some sample data using the <strong>Dataverse</strong> (previously known as the Common Data Service). We'll then create each of the three different types of Power Apps: Canvas, model-driven, and portals, while looking at the various types of connectors you can use to connect to different data sources.</p><p>Next up is <strong>Power Automate</strong>. Using our free Developer edition, we'll create several automated flows, and the different triggers and actions you can use.</p><p>The next app is <strong>Power Virtual Agents</strong>. We'll create a basic chatbot which can ask and answer a few questions. We'll then see how you can find out how well it is performing.</p><p>We will have a brief look at the <strong>AI Builder</strong>, and how models such as the business card reader, object detection model, form processing model and prediction model can be integrated into Power Apps and Power Automate.</p><p>We'll finish off by looking at how Power Platform can extend other business solutions, and some Power Platform administration and security.</p><p>No prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Power Platform trial!</p><p>There are <strong>regular quizzes</strong> to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.</p><p>Once you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of Power Platform and what the capacities of these different apps are.
