Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</p><p>Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a <em>pallavi</em>, an <em>anupallavi</em>, <em>muktaayi swaras</em>, a <em>charanam</em>, and <em>chittaswaras</em>. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).</p><p>Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.</p><p><strong>Types of varnams</strong></p><p>Named for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, <em>tana varnams</em> only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.</p><p>With rhythmic elements like a padam, <em>pada varnams</em> are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the <em>tana varnam</em> which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a <em>pada varnam</em> also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, <em>pada varnams</em> contain more lyrical content than a <em>tana varnam</em>.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.<em>Padajathi varnams</em> are simply <em>pada varnams</em> that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.</p><p><strong>Contents of a varnam</strong></p><p>The name \"varnam\" (meaning \"letter\") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.</p><p>Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.</p><p>The varnam is subdivided into several sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pallavi</strong>: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anupallavi</strong>: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muktaayi</strong>: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like <em>s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one</em>). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charanam</strong>: Sung with lyrics</p></li><li><p><strong>Chitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram</strong>: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anubandham</strong>: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.</p></li></ul><p>Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.</p><p>Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, <em>Adi Tala</em> (8 beat cycle) and <em>Ata Tala</em> (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the <em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice</p><p><strong>Famous varnams</strong></p><p><em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams include :</p><ul><li><p>\"Sami Ninne\" in <em>Shree ragam</em> composed by <em>Karur Devudu Iyer</em> in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Ninnukori\" in <em>Mohanam ragam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Evvari Bodhana\" in <em>Abhogi ragam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Era Naapai\" in <em>Todi raagam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Valachi Vacchi\" in <em>Navaraagamalika</em> in Telugu (9 ragas, similar to <em>Ragamalika</em> which literally translates to a <em>garland of ragams</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Ata Tala</em> Varnams include:</p><ul><li><p>\"Viriboni\" in <em>Bhairavi ragam</em> by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Nera Nammiti\" in <em>Kaanada raagam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Chalamela\" in <em>Sankarabharanam</em> by Swati Tirunal in Telugu</p></li></ul><p>The <em>Arabhi</em> ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.</p><p>The \"Mathe Malayadhwaja\" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancers</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-10-07_14-34-01-cb6fa294290f4137dc71c52dde409964/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=q_OWN8MA2XFr2iQXV1QAAQ%3D%3D%2C1637182293"}, {"course_id": "4225332", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Utreon Masterclass - Ultimate Guide to YouTube Alternative", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "27", "students": "16020", "coupon_code": "6135403D2834313CDFDB", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4225332_8269.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/utreon-course/?couponCode=6135403D2834313CDFDB", "end_day": "2021-11-21 03:00:09+00:00", "headline": "Learn about Content Creation on Utreon - The newest YouTube Alternative", "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Utreon Masterclass - Ultimate Guide to YouTube Alternative!</strong></p><p>The only course you will need to start with Utreon, one of the best and newest video hosting platforms and YouTube alternatives for aspiring content creators.</p><p>Utreon is a relatively new video hosting platform that allows you to host your channel and content and gain access to large and untapped audiences that is simply impossible to reach nowadays on YouTube.

Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham ( ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc )</p><p>Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a <em>pallavi</em>, an <em>anupallavi</em>, <em>muktaayi swaras</em>, a <em>charanam</em>, and <em>chittaswaras</em>. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).</p><p>Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.</p><p><strong>Types of varnams</strong></p><p>Named for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, <em>tana varnams</em> only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.</p><p>With rhythmic elements like a padam, <em>pada varnams</em> are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the <em>tana varnam</em> which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a <em>pada varnam</em> also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, <em>pada varnams</em> contain more lyrical content than a <em>tana varnam</em>.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.<em>Padajathi varnams</em> are simply <em>pada varnams</em> that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.</p><p><strong>Contents of a varnam</strong></p><p>The name \"varnam\" (meaning \"letter\") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.</p><p>Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.</p><p>The varnam is subdivided into several sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pallavi</strong>: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anupallavi</strong>: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muktaayi</strong>: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like <em>s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one</em>). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charanam</strong>: Sung with lyrics</p></li><li><p><strong>Chitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram</strong>: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anubandham</strong>: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.</p></li></ul><p>Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.</p><p>Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, <em>Adi Tala</em> (8 beat cycle) and <em>Ata Tala</em> (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the <em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice.</p><p><strong>Famous varnams</strong></p><p><em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams include :</p><ul><li><p>\"Sami Ninne\" in <em>Shree ragam</em> composed by <em>Karur Devudu Iyer</em> in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Ninnukori\" in <em>Mohanam ragam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Evvari Bodhana\" in <em>Abhogi ragam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Era Naapai\" in <em>Todi raagam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Valachi Vacchi\" in <em>Navaraagamalika</em> in Telugu (9 ragas , similar to <em>Ragamalika</em> which literally translates to a <em>garland of ragams</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Ata Tala</em> Varnams include:</p><ul><li><p>\"Viriboni\" in <em>Bhairavi ragam</em> by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Nera Nammiti\" in <em>Kaanada raagam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Chalamela\" in <em>Sankarabharanam</em> by Swati Tirunal in Telugu</p></li></ul><p>The <em>Arabhi</em> ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.</p><p>The \"Mathe Malayadhwaja\" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancers</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-11-14_18-02-56-6c3a092d6cb8f40358dff15d5163f0ac/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637182425&Signature=cDorwlPDFF-jJfD2ajhtqHflHm~pxg2lCMWEUoQTUlc5g5TBwFXDVRRxcsMUKidPxjvokmED8Su2Lr8ZmK8iwuYtfx~3wSZioVGXY1SUPXrKg-dWn19J3C9WNLD67kxFb0yKe5wB1q6MwW-fy~sekxOWd200nE~MLuQZAjTpE0bi5R1Lkx4bjkkqo1bda2wxK9rtzDIbSv0MaqOaMX497GeQU4-yb3uduBGMZO6ey9LHAMZCbQ09OkCxuOTn0cNsI7rw5wIyPyPh5pMDdI2mmVDw14VvyEF1oJ2dUrKcrnv6yySJ4GUuqUX0FwWzgVCiqiJogJUvHzbt6Id5VI1Rng__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3295220", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Leadership", "title": "Dealing With Difficult People", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Sinan Cetiner", "duration": "35 mins", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "103", "students": "11732", "coupon_code": "NOV2021", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3295220_ae95_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/dealing-with-difficult-people-h/?couponCode=NOV2021", "end_day": "2021-11-22 10:14:40+00:00", "headline": "You can't control other people, you can only control how you respond to them.", "description": "<p><strong>Dealing with Difficult People</strong></p><p>Difficult people defy logic.

If done correctly, words can be used as a mechanism of persuasion. Words can be used to further career goals, relationships, business goals, and just about any other facet of life. The focal point of this course is to provide a theoretical and practical guide to the mechanics behind persuasive writing. In other words, writing with a purpose, or intent. One of the most prevalent forms of persuasive writing is found in copywriting. Copywriting is best defined as the usage of written text for the purpose of marketing, sales, or advertising. Well written sales copy, will ultimately persuade a person or group of people to take a particular action.<br><br>This course offers a comprehensive guide to persuasive writing.

It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.</p><p>A Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).</p><p>It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!</p><p>This course will help you explore how working on an Agile project using Kanban has benefits for your development team, your end users, and your organization as a whole.</p><p>We will identify various process flow related issues including too much work in progress, underutilization of resources, lengthy tasks, unequal sized tasks etc. using simple and easy to understand demonstrations on Kanban board.</p><p>We will not only identify these inefficiencies but also solve for the same by continuously improving the process flow using Kanban Board.</p><p>Here is a list of the topics we will cover in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to Kanban &amp; Kanban Board</p></li><li><p>Finding Inefficiencies in the Process</p></li><li><p>Limiting Work in Progress</p></li><li><p>Under utilization of Resources</p></li><li><p>Unequal Sized Tasks</p></li><li><p>Marking the Tasks</p></li><li><p>Other Inefficiencies/Issues</p></li></ul><p><em>Kanban Practices</em></p><ul><li><p>Defining Done</p></li><li><p>Daily Stand up</p></li><li><p>Specifying Rules</p></li></ul><p><em>Key Agile Concepts</em></p><ul><li><p>Understanding &amp; Creating <strong>User Stories, Theme &amp; Epic</strong></p></li><li><p>What is <strong>Product Backlog</strong></p></li><li><p>Difference between <strong>Product Backlog &amp; Product Roadmap</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Agile</strong></p></li><li><p>How <strong>Estimation</strong> is done in Agile</p></li><li><p>Why <strong>Relative Estimation</strong> in Agile</p></li><li><p><strong>T-Shirt &amp; Fibonacci</strong> Estimation</p></li><li><p><strong>Planing Poker</strong> in Agile</p></li><li><p><strong>Understanding &amp; Creating Burn down Charts </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Team Velocity</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is ideal for <strong>software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone that would have an interest and gain benefit from running an Agile project and delivering maximum value early to your customers.</strong></p><p>No prior experience is necessary to take this course.
