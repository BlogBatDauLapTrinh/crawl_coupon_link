You can also take <strong>quizzes</strong> to check your understanding of concepts like Business Statistics and Analytics in MS Excel. Each section contains a <strong>practice assignment</strong> for you to practically implement your learning on Business Analysis in MS Excel.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this course?</strong></p><p>The analysis of data is not the main crux of analytics. It is the interpretation that helps provide insights after the application of analytical techniques that makes analytics such an important discipline. We have used the most popular analytics software tool which is MS Excel. This will aid the students who have no prior coding background to learn and implement&nbsp; Statistics and Analytics concepts to actually solve real-world problems of Business Analysis.</p><p>Let me give you a brief overview of the course</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 1 - Excel for data analytics</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the first section, i.e. Excel for data analytics, we will learn how to use excel for data-related operations such as calculating, transforming, matching, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.</p><p>We will also cover how to use different types of charts to visualize the data and discover hidden data patterns.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 2 - Statistics foundations for business analysts</strong></p></li></ul><p>Then, in the second section, i.e. Statistics foundations for business analysts, we will start learning about the core concepts of Business Analytics i.e. probability and probability distribution. We will look at important probability distributions used in a business setting such as Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution, Binomial&nbsp; distribution etc</p><p>These concepts form the foundation of data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 3 -</strong> <strong>Statistical Decision making</strong></p></li></ul><p>Once we have covered the basics of probability, in the 3rd section, i.e. Statistical Decision making we will discuss some advanced concepts related to sample testing i.e. hypothesis testing.</p><p>These are the concepts that differentiate a beginner from a pro!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 4 - Optimizing Business Models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the fourth section, i.e. Optimizing Business Models we will learn how to solve common business problems with the help of excel's data analytics tools such as solver, goal seek, scenario manager, etc.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 5 - Preprocessing Data for ML models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn what actions you need to take step by step to get the data and then prepare it for analysis, these steps are very important. We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bivariate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 6 - Linear regression model for predicting metrics</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge on Business Statistics and Business Analysis using MS Excel, and the skillsets of a Business Analyst to immediately see practical benefits in your workplace.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this Statistics for Business Analytics course!</strong></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-09-22_12-31-22-b4e7b0c3fa3d8be0c8886aae58d86684/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1640516114&Signature=OkehcbF85wetHr-4oq37OeQZzaGCqibRn8QqGGdKUc0sSmNYPGMJuhFq6rDENPr14iP-T7uz69bPC7D0IJu0kFUBy~n8itb5hMTOEwz1DtRjc5umwVzWlKTVidEbwfgkp4ovhy2dEanK~MIAg4YaxrP68z3cPtutYOw74eKw7iqNxenf1e88FD0ZN5Gc3oHQMTpYZfHBd~85LLfOhcpJGzppel8MxI4kfSjFOGIPATdd0ck2OGE2HlQGF24yrBk2RMe8EIGr8FrBzXn46eV5o-yCTvbMd8lKKLZWSeXv181TLacz0CXtImJA1fD99-exnGLA9zmZupfFh9L0H-XUUg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4057106", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "NFT for Dummies", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "George Proorocu", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "217", "students": "29746", "coupon_code": "5678A3336289D4ADB645", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4057106_76d8_8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/nft-trading-course/?couponCode=5678A3336289D4ADB645", "end_day": "2021-12-30 21:46:19+00:00", "headline": "Crash course in the basics of creating and trading NFTs as a digital asset", "description": "<p>Dear students and others interested in Non- Fungible Tokens,</p><p><br></p><p>Whereas most <strong>NFT</strong> courses highlight technological components, our course introduces NFTs from both the <strong>IT</strong> and <strong>financial </strong>/ <strong>legal</strong> perspective.

You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use ML/ DL models to create predictive models and solve real world business problems.</p><p>Below is a list of popular<strong> FAQs </strong>of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-</p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-07-13_14-48-30-881f18f74541b6286f76bb8a6ee67ce0/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1640516279&Signature=i2XivLpoOWPBFeBr5ux1fTroOyUPiw8M8ty6nAJSygY~Wyup0HcbMyibaNM-NVDIyTsFp8t-CixlNku08H5DppnyqGhdnoz76iePU5qzXQK3AGM9GSxl0TPCGOIYpESk2BLZp5kMSEhHiBTNbFS~qpLvwLhgnJTmCzYWUl~ht9NNnRZ75CCSVRJevaNrrDijyjuGxvDBGN4s0J5lTaYg1~rPIcEskNIjohj-RnouOuDVtmQYwWcc589r~1TNMLvjZF4UipI315WvLHVUfQwDkI4OvFfxLn2FWewcutSjh0G40mN-dII4yQdzTxs6m02AnheQT51jk1yILEV8PIzVAw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4398080", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Real Estate", "title": "Cambio de Uso de Local a Vivienda", "level": "All Levels", "author": "\u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda", "duration": "26,5 horas", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "791", "coupon_code": "15CURSOSGRATIS", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4398080_4c6a_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/local-vivienda/?couponCode=15CURSOSGRATIS", "end_day": "2021-12-30 09:14:26+00:00", "headline": "Conoce las Claves, Fundamentos y Estrategias para el Cambio de Uso de Local a Vivienda", "description": "<p><strong>Cambio de Uso de Local a Vivienda</strong></p><p><em>Convi\u00e9rtete en un Experto en Cambio de Uso de Local a Vivienda</em></p><p><strong>Instructores</strong>: Arquitecto \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda y Arquitecta Luc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez&nbsp; <strong>Actualizado:</strong> Diciembre de 2021<em>&nbsp; </em><strong>Estudiantes: </strong>+3.000</p><p><strong>Calificaci\u00f3n:</strong> \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Descripci\u00f3n del Curso:</strong></p><p>La formaci\u00f3n te permitir\u00e1 convertirte en un experto en la materia, y todo ello desde una formaci\u00f3n principalmente pr\u00e1ctica.
