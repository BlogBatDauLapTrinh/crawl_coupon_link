Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.</p><p>The general idea we want to keep in our mind is that businesses are looking to invest assets in order to receive a return. Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.</p><p>We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.</p><p>The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-06-24_03-07-22-b9a0707f018e7f72b318010bfa0b42a5/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1638127632&Signature=Ax5x0JwZYT95H7rU6uQTo4DlkHb6m~iWhLOtoPGvWNJhcqFIrtxLupOljBVKFFs00DLSQ3vVYrjEX1tmCH0izjER0jwcs3X1r1CZM0Ja1QLMq3eEFnY0wFixVfJDzRkTGjn~dx-5Okyh75gihoUE3z-Abp5DlE6ZYtmws~MhGwQ-yCQeYDuYwq4TgPCsKccan25QXwtQ~Vho3yxe-23LlCyqRbDRM3MqjfLtca8io227qEtuNEDRJTnjP2lToEemu4NTiVPX7uXBlroi52d-iNNeIm8XqCAvo~GyG2ZglkTUn63BY6gHDtU1exPaDtRV-NcbTPdjtu4iji5kMtQbMA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2641750", "category": "Design", "sub_category": "Graphic Design & Illustration", "title": "Adobe Photoshop Photo Preset Basics", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "31 mins", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "20", "students": "14109", "coupon_code": "TRY100FREE112106", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2641750_820b_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-photoshop-photo-presets/?couponCode=TRY100FREE112106", "end_day": "2021-12-29 12:59:10+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Adobe Photoshop Photo Preset Basics", "description": "<p>SO, YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR A COURSE THAT WILL TEACH YOU PHOTOSHOP PHOTO PRESETS QUICKLY &amp; IN A FUN MANNER?</p><p>I\u2019ve got just the course for you!</p><p>Welcome, my name is Josh Werner with Learn Tech Plus and I\u2019ve put this course together to help people just like you quickly master Photoshop Photo Presets...Whether you\u2019re a beginner or experienced with existing Photoshop Photo Presets!</p><p>If your goal is to become a user of Photoshop Photo Presets, then this course is perfect for you.
