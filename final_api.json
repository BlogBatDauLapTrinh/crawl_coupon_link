You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE.

This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=_ORNx44rhk4L0-5Cn4EPYQ%3D%3D%2C1637433923"}, {"course_id": "3353858", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Learn 6 SIMPLE Steps to Make Money on TikTok App!", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Roope Kiuttu", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "61", "students": "19236", "coupon_code": "FDACEC6B5E957F49B05B", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3353858_0c9c_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/make-money-on-tiktok/?couponCode=FDACEC6B5E957F49B05B", "end_day": "2021-11-21 14:38:21+00:00", "headline": "Learn SIMPLE SECRETS to Make Money Using Just Your Phone + TikTok App!", "description": "<p><strong>How would you feel like when making $10,000's just by using your smartphone?</strong></p><p>Benefits of Making Money on TikTok App:</p><ul><li><p>You can do this worldwide!</p></li><li><p>You can make money for 100% FREE!</p></li><li><p>TikTok is the most downloaded app in the world right now!</p></li><li><p>Steps are really SIMPLE!</p></li><li><p>The earning potential is HUGE!</p></li></ul><p>--</p><p>While I&nbsp;can't guarantee you any money&nbsp;(by law)&nbsp;but let me tell you a short story from my own life...</p><p>There are 3 stages:</p><p><strong>1) First Touch with TikTok App</strong></p><p>In 2019, I&nbsp;heard about TikTok for the first time...</p><p>Some of my friends who are making money online started testing that app.</p><p>My first thoughts were like, \"Hey guys...

Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4401607", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Online Education", "title":

Some of the world\u2019s top tech teams use the tool to design scalable, easy-to-maintain solutions \u2014 Netflix, PayPal, eBay, Airbnb, and more. Why are businesses so interested in React.js implementation? Here are the benefits of adopting the framework:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increased app development speed.</strong> The framework accepts HTML code input and has excellent subcomponent rendering support. Development teams can benefit from JSX as well \u2014 it\u2019s an extension with a range of shortcuts that cuts the amount of code writing time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved code stability</strong>. React.js reduces the impact of change in the code file since the changes in parent components don\u2019t affect the children. Such a data binding approach facilitates software testing and helps ensure stable app performance after update deployments.</p></li><li><p><strong>SEO-friendliness.</strong> React.js deals with the inability of search engine crawlers to process JS-heavy pages. Even a beginner with an entry-level react developer salary can deploy React on a server and use the virtual DOM to view the code as a regular web page in a browser.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robust toolkit.</strong> React.js has a wide range of debugging and interface design tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong user community and an affordable remote react developer salary.</strong> Since a large number of teams are deploying the framework, the tool is regularly updated. There\u2019s no shortage of user-generated content either \u2014 you can find dozens of helpful React tutorials and case studies to make the most out of the framework.</p></li></ul><p>Asking for a Senior react developer salary. It\u2019s one of the most in-demand frameworks at the moment \u2014 that\u2019s why business owners are willing to find professionals with a moderate mid-level react developer salary within and beyond their home regions.<br><br><strong>Enroll now!! see you in class.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Happy learning<br>Team Edyoda </strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-02-04_11-10-33-6b0521575b1aa00dd28320285d8f966d/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637433977&Signature=WoDLLUR7YNAB6tp41AHCdCM3T7a29saASn7ElmRhoEzE~p1w6KYXYbXOLHfvOMC82EYIilU4LqimfACFg3WHNOSCsnWfr4e1A~GbRRFod2RBIg5-oll3vb3xuLVPTyE1dqsSET5w8wKosIhCj0l8kczE~gm-7n9K83L3a5Opo3IsV-K2vLlktX1wa4mCfBwUpaYg~JcejdTZW85Q92klHtWK3FJ2f-zWv3~g8Ols~JLXuBC~ouF~IaXm2MeMrHxrdA-ctXNR3ncsZyK7Zsatj-YcWyZyagg7HcGoKYW4jOiZuQVhnDvMJsbL3s9tqWgBRldY64kRAVbsJO273GuUbg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2650218", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Science", "title": "Astronomie mit Handy Apps superleicht!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Michael Ferdinand Schnitzer-Trpin", "duration": "38 Min.", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "12", "students": "6459", "coupon_code": "D655F93D415AC0F8CDD6", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2650218_96ca_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/astronomie-mit-handy-apps/?couponCode=D655F93D415AC0F8CDD6", "end_day": "2021-11-21 21:06:08+00:00", "headline": "Mit dem Handy den Nachthimmel erkunden", "description": "<p>In diesem Kurs lernst du 5 Apps kennen, die du auf dein Handy/Tablet kostenlos bzw. f\u00fcr wenig Geld laden kannst.

Finish your Udemy course and Contact us to get your Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Certificate!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Membership Sites Are Perfect For Passive Income?</strong><br></p><p>If you\u2019re interested in making money online, then it\u2019s probably because you&nbsp;like the idea of having more freedom to live and work wherever and&nbsp;however you want. The benefits of working online are many and varied and\nextend into every aspect of your life.</p><p>But in order for you to make the very most from this way of working, you&nbsp;also need to make sure you choose the perfect business model. Working&nbsp;online on its own does not necessarily equate to an ideal lifestyle; rather\nthe benefits come when you work online in the right way. And let me tell&nbsp;you: creating a membership site is definitely the right way.</p><p> Working online is easy. If you are in a job that\u2019s fairly flexible, then you&nbsp;should be able to ask your employer if you can work from home and simply&nbsp;log into the company\u2019s network whenever you start working. And sure, this will bring some benefits: you\u2019ll be able to stay in bed longer and stop commuting and you\u2019ll have the luxury of&nbsp;being able to drink tea, listen to&nbsp;music and generally create a comfortable environment.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>But you\u2019re still ultimately a slave to your job. You\u2019re still trading \u2018time for&nbsp;hours\u2019 and you\u2019ll still need to be available for the hours between 9am-5pm. </p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019ll probably also need to be near the phone and you\u2019ll be expected to&nbsp;output a certain amount of work every day. That means you probably can\u2019t&nbsp;leave the house and work outdoors in case you lose your internet&nbsp;connection. And it means you can decide to stop working for the day and&nbsp;visit a friend instead. Worst of all, you can still be \u2018told off\u2019 by your boss \u2013&nbsp;reprimanded like a child! </p><p><br></p><p>The same goes for creating your own online business. If you\u2019re a web&nbsp;designer for example, then you have the freedom to decide when you work&nbsp;on projects. But you probably still have deadlines and to all extents and&nbsp;purposes, your clients are your bosses. If you fail to complete </p><p> </p><p>This is why so many people find the idea of blogging desirable. All you&nbsp;have to do is to create and manage a website that you hopefully find&nbsp;fascinating and really enjoy writing about. You\u2019ll get to experience a lot of the satisfaction that comes from running your own business. And you get&nbsp;passive income, meaning that you\u2019ll earn money while you sleep.&nbsp;But even this isn\u2019t perfect. Because one day, you might earn $200 and the&nbsp;next day you might earn $10.</p><p>\nIt only takes a change to Google\u2019s search algorithm and you can lose all of&nbsp;your progress. What\u2019s more, is that it takes actually a huge amount of time&nbsp;to build up the amount of traffic that you need to make a big profit from a&nbsp;blog. This is especially true if you are planning to use pay-per-click&nbsp;advertising but it\u2019s equally the case if you are selling your own product.</p><p>\nThink about it: how often do you click ads on other websites? This is why it&nbsp;typically takes 1K visitors for you to generate just one or two clicks and the&nbsp;same goes for sales of products. It\u2019s a huge amount of work before you&nbsp;start earning anything and there\u2019s no guarantee it will ever get to the point&nbsp;where it can provide a livable salary.</p><p><br></p><p>Enter: Recurring, Passive Income</p><p>This is where membership site come in and offer an incredibly appealing alternative. Essentially, a membership website is a site that users pay to subscribe to. This normally works by first enticing the reader with some free content and showing them the kind of entertainment/information/value that you\u2019re capable of providing. Once they\u2019re hooked, you then make sure they know that they need to subscribe in order to gain access to your very best content and to get frequently updated.</p><p><br></p><p>So what\u2019s so different about this? Well for starters, it means that you can&nbsp;much more easily convert visitors to paying customers seeing as they\u2019re&nbsp;not having to put down a large amount of money and seeing as they know&nbsp;what they\u2019re getting right away.</p><p><br></p><p>More importantly, though, it means that the money is recurring and much&nbsp;more predictable. Unlike a regular blog that can very much fluctuate,&nbsp;having subscribers means you probably have some kind of agreement or&nbsp;standing order set up. This means that you can practically guarantee that&nbsp;you\u2019ll be able to earn a set amount of money each week, month or quarter.</p><p><br></p><p>And that very quickly starts to add up\u2026</p><p>So say you currently have people subscribing for $5 membership a month. If your&nbsp;content is good, then you could realistically convince one in every 1-10,000&nbsp;people to sign up. But it\u2019s very possible the very first person who visits&nbsp;might sign up!

It is the predominant technology used to drive enterprise-scale business technology. Companies have chosen .NET because for its proven scalability, reliability, and support.</p><p>The .NET language of choice to learn is C#, as it is among the most widely used languages today. It\u2019s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications. As such, there is a high demand across the world for .NET developers in a variety of industries, so that means that more jobs are available for candidates with a foundation built upon .NET technologies.</p><p><strong>About This Course</strong></p><p>In this course, you will also learn how to use Javascript, JQuery and JQueryUI and Ajax to develop dynamic and user friendly user interfaces. All interfaces will be keenly styled using the standard Bootstrap CSS Framework, which is used to maintain a standard look and feel across all pages. </p><p><strong>At the end of this course, you should be able to: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Build a fully data driven web application</p></li><li><p>Understand the MVC Folder Structure</p></li><li><p>Add Data models to your project using Entity Framework</p></li><li><p>Write basic LINQ queries</p></li><li><p>Understand how Models, Views and Controllers combine to facilitate a web application</p></li><li><p>Understand Razor Syntax in views </p></li><li><p>Understand C#&nbsp;Model Classes</p></li><li><p>Understand how to add views and actions to a controller</p></li><li><p>Use Bootstrap to insert JavaScript controls (sliders, etc), button and text styles and manipulate the overall layout</p></li><li><p>Upload a project to GitHub</p></li><li><p>Manage Packages in an MVC Project</p></li><li><p>User JQuery and tools to increase interactivity and animations on the interface.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>To take this course, you will need to have some knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, if not C#. Even if you do not have much exposure to the .NET development stack, this course is very beginner friendly and chock full of development tips. </p><p>This course has over 6 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each module in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.</p><p>By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio and examined logic and syntax errors so much, that it will be second nature for you when working in the .NET environment.

The MAT is an admissions exam accepted by many graduate programs in the United States. Additionally, it is used by many high-IQ societies all over the world as an admission requirement. The MAT goal is to assess logical and analytical reasoning through completion of partial analogies. The test duration is 1 hour and contains 120 questions. Exam formats include both <strong>Computer-Based Tests (CBT)</strong> and paper and pencil format.</p><p>This free practice exam features realistic questions that will help you not only review key vocabulary, but also familiarize yourself with the MAT\u2019s 120 Analogy exam format. This exam is also very good preparation for those preparing for the GRE Test, as both exams cover analogies.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>The MAT is a one hundred item, fifty minute verbal analogies test. All of the questions will be in the form of A:B:C:D. The analogies are written so that A is to B as C is to D. However, your job will be to fill in the missing term by correctly identifying the relationship that exists.</p><p><strong>Test Centers, Dates, and Fees</strong></p><p>Currently, there are more than six hundred testing centers in fifty states as well as in several foreign countries. If you live more than one hundred miles away from a designated test center, special accommodations can be made. Dates will vary by testing site, so be sure to consult with the test site. The average fee to take the MAT is about $50, though that varies by region.</p><p><strong>Scores</strong></p><p>When you register to take the MAT, you are asked to provide up to three addresses that you wish to have your score reports sent. Sending your test scores to three schools is included in the test administration fee. However, it is your responsibility to provide accurate addresses for the schools.</p><p><strong>History of the MAT</strong></p><p>According to the Miller Analogies Test Manual (1970) the test was developed to measure scholastic aptitude at the graduate school level. It is also developed to measure how well the test taker can recognize relationships between words.</p><p>Vocabulary plays a very important role on this test. Before you can correctly identify the relationship that exists between the words, you must be able to recognize and comprehend the meaning of the answer choices. Often, it is not reasoning that makes test items difficult.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job.

While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns.
