The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called <em>digital representation</em> or, more specifically, a <em>digital image</em>, for the object, and <em>digital form</em>, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitate processing by digital computers and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.</p><p>Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\". Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organizations around the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Haytham H.

In this course, you will learn how to boost your imagination, accelerate your creativity, and make your ideas happen! The unique method consists of mind, strategy, and design actions that allow you to convert ideas into reality.</p><p>SOUZOU is a method developed by Masaaki Hasegawa using scientific findings. It is designed to boost your imagination, develop strategies, and identify concrete steps to make ideas happen. In the course, you will also learn how to maximize your performance. It is not a theory that Masaaki and a number of people have applied to their lives.</p><p>SOUZOU will allow you to boost your imagination, accelerate your creativity, and make your ideas happen. You will learn step by step how your mind works, how to develop strategies to increase the probability of making your ideas happen, and how to design actions in order to convert your ideas into reality. To implement the method effectively, this course also helps you understand how you can boost your performance to accelerate the process of conceiving ideas to converting them into reality. All the creative and innovative ideas come from imagination, and thus the key to boosting your creativity is liberating your imagination to be able to imagine something that does not exist in the present reality. You will learn how to remove the limits you have in your imagination to boost it. Then, to realize your idea, you almost always have to work with limited resources such as time, money, and people. That is why creativity in the execution is embedded into connecting dots differently, or more precisely, finding connections among irrelevant things.

I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part).

We had to trail through 4 hours of videotape to identify the culprit.</em></p><p><em>Whilst mauling over the situation I directed my thoughts to Romans 8 and considered that this will work together for my good somehow. At the time of writing, I have been blessed with a wonderful replacement car newer than mine and beautiful to behold. Amidst the seemingly unfortunate incident, God orchestrated a new type of enjoyment for me\".</em></p><p>So it is with the 2nd letter to the Corinthians. Although the tone and text reflect Paul\u2019s angry defense of his apostleship to those who should have appreciated him; many divine revelations are fervently embedded in this letter.</p><p>Working through the hands of Paul, the greatest Communicator the Holy Spirit has released some life-changing truths to us. </p><p>For example, it is here we receive the most comprehensive teaching on \"How To Give\" in the New Testament. Let\u2019s remember lessons that expound many of the Old Testaments teachings from Genesis and Exodus. There are other thought-provoking and invaluable topics covering:</p><ul><li><p>The New Creation</p></li><li><p>Paul\u2019s sufferings</p></li><li><p>3rd Heaven</p></li></ul><p>All in all, this results in a life-transforming portion of Scripture that I hope you find deserving to be studied just as I discovered.
