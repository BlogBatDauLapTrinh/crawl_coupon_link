I have generated leads at only 6 rs per lead with the help of strategy shared by you and by optimising my business manager to be ready for apple restrictions in your Udemy course. I have a facebook and instagram page since last 1 and a half years for my music academy business. Before buying your course, My cost per lead used to be 35 to 50 rs per lead through my conventional targeting. But after I studied under you, I ran conversion ads for leads by targeting custom audience of people who engaged on my facebook and instagram page and 1% lookalike audience of these custom audiences in India and it worked like a magic. 6 rs per lead is very very cheap and I am saving lot of money.

It's important to know what you want to achieve in order to choose the right objective. Your advertising objective is what you want people to do when they see your ads. For example, if you want to show your website to people interested in your business, you can create ads that encourage people to visit your website. As your business grows, your campaign goals will change. First, your campaigns may focus on building awareness and acquiring new customers. Later, you may encourage people to make a purchase or sign up for an event.</p><p><em>DAY 3: Learn How to Use Facebook Ads Library</em></p><p>Facebook Ads Library was designed to give anyone and everyone accesses to advertising taking place on Facebook. This approach is to promote transparency sharing as much information as possible. You have access to a collection of all advertisements running from across Facebook Products, including Instagram.</p><p><em>DAY 4: Learn Copywriting for your Facebook Ads. Create your own Facebook Ad Copy.</em></p><ol><li><p>Put all crucial info at the start of your copy</p></li><li><p>Emojis are your best friend</p></li><li><p>Keep it brief</p></li><li><p>Give people a reason to purchase</p></li><li><p>Remember \u2013 it\u2019s always about the sell.</p></li><li><p>Create copy tailored to your audience.</p></li><li><p>Use power words to inspire emotion.</p></li><li><p>Include social proof.</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 5: Learn How to Setup &amp; Use Facebook Business Manager</em></p><p>The purpose of Facebook Business Manager is to help you \u201cmanage ad accounts, Facebook pages, and the people who work on them \u2014 all in one place.\u201d Business Manager is more or less the hub for accessing all of your Facebook marketing needs, including ad accounts, catalogs, pixels, and business pages.</p><p><em>DAY 6: Learn How to Proceed Domain Verification</em></p><p>Apple has announced changes with iOS 14 that impact how Facebook receives and processes conversion events from business tools like the Facebook pixel. Domain verification helps Facebook ensure that only the rightful parties can edit link previews that direct to your content. Once you have verified your domain, you can assign specific Pages editing permissions for your ads. Pages associated with your Business Manager that do not have editing permissions won\u2019t be able to make changes to your ads.</p><p><em>It's free to verify your domains. There are 3 domain verification methods:</em></p><ol><li><p>Add a meta tag to your domain's home page</p></li><li><p>Upload an HTML file to your web directory and confirm ownership of your domain in Business Manager</p></li><li><p>Add a DNS TXT entry to your DNS record to confirm ownership of your domain</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 7: Learn How to Easily Setup Facebook Pixel &amp; Conversion API on WordPress</em></p><p>When you use the Conversions API along with our other Facebook Business Tools, you can gain additional insights into the people who interact with your business. Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.</p><p>The Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don't require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.</p><p><em>The Conversions API can help you to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity. Data from the Conversions API is less impacted than the pixel by browser loading errors, connectivity issues and ad blockers. When you use the Conversions API alongside the pixel, it creates a more reliable connection that helps the delivery system decrease your cost per action.</p></li><li><p>Optimize ads for actions that happen later in the customer\u2019s journey. Examples of these events include actions that happen after a purchase (such as subscriptions), actions that happen in stores, or even customer scores. This information helps Facebook show your ads to customers who are more likely to be profitable and generate value for your business.</p></li><li><p>Improve measurement. The Conversions API can help you better measure ad performance and attribution across your customer\u2019s full journey, from discovery to conversion. This helps you better understand how digital advertising impacts both online and offline results.</p></li><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of increased event matching. Your marketing data is most effective when it can be matched with accounts on Facebook apps and services. With the Conversions API, you can include additional customer information parameters that help increase matched events and your Event Match Quality score.</p></li><li><p>Increase data control. When implemented separately from the pixel, the Conversions API gives you more control over what you share and when you share it.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 8: Learn How to Use &amp; Setup Pixel Events. Learn Using Events Manager.</em></p><p>Facebook uses marketing data to show ads to people who are likely to be interested in them. One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).</p><p><em>DAY 9: Learn How to Use, Setup &amp; Optimise Facebook Aggregated Events</em></p><p>Facebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users. Aggregated Event Measurement limits domains to 8 conversion events that can be prioritized for conversion optimization. So, please, learn with me Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads for 2022. If you optimize your ads for non-prioritized events, your ads won\u2019t deliver to and report on people who are opted-out of tracking on their Facebook or Instagram apps on an iOS 14.5 or later device. Facebook solution is analogous to Apple\u2019s Private Click Measurement, but it is designed to solve for key advertiser use cases not addressed by Apple\u2019s proposal. </p><p><em>DAY 10: Learn Facebook Reach Ads</em></p><p>The reach objective maximizes the number of people who see your ads and how often they see them. Choose this objective if you want to build brand awareness, change brand perception or show your ad to as many people in your audience as possible. With this objective, you can choose to maximize your reach or impressions for the entire duration of your campaign. You can set frequency controls for how many times a person sees your ad and the minimum number of days between each time they see it. For example, let's say you want your ads to reach a large proportion of your target audience to help increase sales. You can also tailor your reach with location targeting to reach people within a certain radius of your business location. You can simply choose the reach objective to show ads to a larger portion of your audience.</p><p><em>DAY 11: Learn Facebook Traffic Ads</em></p><p>The traffic objective is designed to drive people to your website or app. With traffic as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Send people to a destination such as a website, app, phone call or Messenger conversation (Website Clicks)</p></li><li><p>Increase the number of people going to your mobile or desktop app (App Engagement)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 12: Learn Detailed Targeting on Facebook &amp; Creating your Persona</em></p><p>Define your audience for smarter ad targeting.With Core Audiences, you set the rules for where your ads are delivered. Adjust your target audience to be as broad or well-defined as you like, based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li><p>Location.Advertise in the cities, communities and countries where you want to do business.</p></li><li><p>Demographics. Choose your audience based on age, gender, education, job title and more. You can keep track of the types of people your ads are reaching, but Facebook will never share personally-identifiable information about them.</p></li><li><p>Interests. Add interests and hobbies of the people you want your ad to reach \u2013 from organic food to action films \u2013 and make your targeted ads more relevant.</p></li><li><p>Behaviour. Target your ads based on consumer behaviours such as prior purchases and device usage.</p></li><li><p>Connections. Choose to include people who are connected to your Facebook Page or event, or exclude them to find new audiences.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 13: Learn How to Create Attractive Video Carousels for Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads</em></p><p>The carousel format lets you show 2 or more images and/or videos in a single ad, each with its own headline, description, link and call to action. To scroll through a carousel, people swipe on their mobile device or click the arrows on their computer screen.</p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages. Give customers more options and help raise your clickthrough rate.</p></li><li><p>Highlight multiple features of a single product. Show different product angles or details to better educate customers.</p></li><li><p>Tell a story. Use images and/or videos in succession to illustrate a compelling narrative.</p></li><li><p>Explain a process. Walk people through how your business works step by step.</p></li><li><p>Sell the benefits. If your business is in the service industry, use images and/or videos to show the benefits to new customers.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 14: Learn about the Power of Engagement. Create Powerful Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences from Engagement.</em></p><p>Nobody knows more about us than our mother, our wife, and Facebook. So it\u2019s very easy for Facebook to create an exact lookalike audience for you. For example, Facebook can create a very similar audience to people that have been already engaging with your content.</p><p><em>DAY 15: Learn Facebook Engagement Ads</em></p><p>The engagement objective is designed to get more people to see and engage with your Facebook post or Page. With engagement as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Boost your posts (Post Engagement)</p></li><li><p>Promote your Page (Page Likes)</p></li><li><p>Raise attendance at an event on your Page (Event Responses)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 16: Learn Facebook Lead Generation Ads</em></p><p>Lead generation is the process of building interest in a business's products or services. On Facebook, you can create campaigns using a lead generation objective that allows consumers to fill out a form, called an \"Instant Form,\" with their contact information.</p><p><em>DAY 17: Learn How to Use Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences to Get Better Results</em></p><p>A Custom Audience is an ad targeting option that lets you find your existing audiences among people who are on Facebook. A lookalike audience is a way your ads can reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they share similar characteristics to your existing customers. </p><p><em>DAY 18: Learn Conversion Ads &amp; Commerce Manager</em></p><p>The Facebook Website Conversion objective helps you to grow business on your website. Whether you want page visits, sales or another action, website conversion ads encourage people to go to your website and do something.</p><ul><li><p>Grow sales. Get people to complete transactions on your website.</p></li><li><p>Prompt an action. Define the action that you want people to take \u2013 from visiting your site, to adding something to their basket.</p></li><li><p>Increase traffic. Encourage people to visit a specific page or explore your whole website.</p></li></ul><p>Conversion ads are special kinds of ads where Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are trying their best to drive audiences to your website that are more likely to buy your products or give you a lead. For these ads you often have to retarget with custom and lookalike audiences. You mainly retarget your website visitors and already engaged people from your Facebook business page and Instagram profile. As every business is different, you can also test standard targeting based on age, interests, location and income.</p><p><em>DAY 19: Learn How to Create Attractive Carousels for E-Commerce</em></p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to sell more on your E-Commerce:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages.

This will aid the students who have no prior coding background to learn and implement HR analytics concepts to actually solve real-world HR problems.</p><p>Let me give you a brief overview of the course</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 1 - Introduction</strong></p><p>In this section, we will learn about the course structure and the meaning of some key terms associated with HR Analytics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 2 - Essential MS Excel formulas and using them to calculate HR metrics</strong></p><p>In this part, we will start with a tutorial on all the popular MS Excel formulas. Then we will see the implementation of these to calculate and automate the HR metrics. This is an important part of HR analytics of a human resource dataset. We also discuss a separate case study where we use Excel to calculate the average cost of external and internal hiring.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 3 -</strong> <strong>Visualization in Excel and HR Dashboarding</strong></p><p>In this part, we will begin with a tutorial on all the popular charts and graphs that can be drawn in MS Excel. Then we will see the implementation of these to create visualize HR analytics of the available HR data. We also discuss a separate case study where we use Excel to build a department-wise demographic distribution of human resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 4 - Data summarization using Pivot tables</strong></p><p>In this part, we will learn about several advanced topics in MS Excel such as Pivot tables, indirect functions, and also about data formatting. Then we will see the implementation of these to create beautiful summaries of HR analytics of the available HR data. We also discuss a separate case study where we use Excel to build a dynamic department wise demographic dashboard and format it to make it presentable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 5 - Basics of Machine Learning and Statistics</strong></p><p>In this part, we introduce the students to the basics of statistics and ML. This part is for students who have no background understanding of ML and statistics concepts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 6 - Preprocessing Data for ML models</strong></p><p>In this section, you will learn what actions you need to take step by step to get the data and then prepare it for analysis these steps are very important. We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bivariate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Part 7 - Linear regression model for predicting metrics</strong></p><p>This section starts with a simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p></li></ul><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look discuss an HR case study where we try to predict the CTC to be offered to new recruits basis their previous experience, past CTC, job location, and qualification.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills related to HR analytics and human resource management to immediately see practical benefits in your workplace.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this HR analytics course!</strong></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "3982702", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "2022 Beginner's guide to Cyber Security", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "George Proorocu", "duration": "92", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "2571", "students": "130838", "coupon_code": "ED7753950880760978A0", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3982702_080f.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2021-beginners-guide-to-cyber-security/?couponCode=ED7753950880760978A0", "end_day": "2022-04-04 21:32:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn from first line experts what is Cyber Security, the latest threats and how to protect against them. #2022", "description": "<p><strong>Why should you enroll? <br></strong><br>Since we've been working in this field for over 15 years, we wanted to share part of what we've learned in all these years with people that are completely new to <strong>Cyber Security</strong>, or people that would like to understand the <strong>2022 basics</strong> in this field. <br>You will find the general information mixed with real-life scenarios and real tips &amp;&nbsp;tricks on how to protect from different threats.<br>Our goal is to use your time in the most efficient way, in order for you to get the most important content in the shortest time.<br><strong><br>What will you know after taking our course? </strong><br><br>1.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients.

Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

It is considered that chickens originate from India, and that the red jungle fowl is an ancestor to today\u2019s modern chicken. The breeding of chickens in captivity dates back to at least 1400 BC in Egypt. But intensive poultry production only&nbsp; before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,&nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.&nbsp; &nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It is the advent of vaccination for conditions such as Marek\u2019s disease, in addition to preproducing good quality day-old chicks starts with the breeder flock.

Manage your time</strong></p><p><strong>During the exam you will have enough time to carefully read every question and its options. You will have 170 minutes to respond to approximately 65 questions.</strong> <strong>That means more than two and a half minutes for each question, however, some questions are more complex than others and, therefore, consume more time.</strong></p><p><strong>It could be a good idea to set yourself some time marks, for example, 20 minutes for every 10 questions, that will give you some time at the end to review the questions you weren\u2019t sure. If you are about to get to your time mark and still have several questions of that 10-question block to evaluate, give quick answers to the remaining questions, mark them for review, and move to the next block.</strong></p><p><strong>Don\u2019t forget to respond all questions, even if you have absolutely no idea. Make your best guess and respond. You still will have a chance to have a right answer, and there aren\u2019t any penalties if you choose the wrong option.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Know your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies</strong></p><p>AWS IAM is the first service that you should configure in any AWS account, and it\u2019s widely used to give access control to AWS resources. That is why it is an extremely important service to know if you work in security. Understanding the policy evaluation logic, and all IAM policy elements is a must.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Embrace encryption</strong></p><p>Encryption improves data security. If you are following the first tip, you should know that sensitive data has to be encrypted. This means you won\u2019t see questions where you have to decide whether or not to encrypt data in an Amazon S3 bucket; instead, you will be asked about what\u2019s the best location to encrypt the data, or the best key management solution to fulfill given requirements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Security Groups vs. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)</strong></p><p>Network security is also critical in cloud environments, and there are several tools to avoid issues. Two of the most important tools are Security Groups and NACLs. Knowing the differences, use cases, and features of both will help increase your exam points.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Be ready to respond to incidents</strong></p><p>Security Engineers are not only in charge of deploying and configuring the security tools to avoid intruders penetrating the systems, they also have to be ready to rapidly detect and respond to incidents, enabling detective capacities, and ensuring access to the necessary services.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6. Get your hands dirty</strong></p><p>Definitely the best way to learn something is by doing it. You could read all available guides from top to bottom, and that couldn\u2019t be enough for you to pass the exam.<strong> You need to practice your skills</strong> in a real environment, and see the services features with your own eyes. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>7. Be paranoid</strong></p><p>As a security engineer you are expected to consider the worst-case scenario for any possible threat, therefore, you should always choose responses with the solution that delivers the best level of security, or those that you think cover the majority of threats. Be careful with exam questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the simplest way?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the most economical option?\u201d. In those cases, you have to resolve the given problem, even if the option is not the best from the security point of view.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>8. Background </strong></p><p><strong>There are no requirements to take AWS Certification exams in a particular order.</strong> Meaning, you can take the AWS Certified Security \u2013 Specialty exam before obtaining any other AWS Certification. Nevertheless, foundational and associate-level certifications, such as AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certified Solutions Architect \u2013 Associate, will help you understand the basics and familiarize you with the exam logistics, the types of questions, how to manage your time, your response strategies, etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4228228", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Video & Mobile Marketing", "title": "VidIQ Masterclass - Full Guide to YouTube Keyword Tool", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "99", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "42", "students": "13308", "coupon_code": "F5CEEF21F225FB07DA96", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4228228_dc74.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/vidiq-course/?couponCode=F5CEEF21F225FB07DA96", "end_day": "2022-04-05 03:36:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Everything about VidIQ, its Features, Licenses, Keyword Research tool and YouTube SEO Optimisation", "description": "<p><em>Finally, a YouTube Channel Management Tool That Makes Creating &amp; Growing A YouTube Channel Fun &amp; Easy!</em></p><p>With the right YouTube channel management tool, you can get a complete overview of your channel and all its analytics and data.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company!

We live in an era of sound bites and 140 character messages, but good writing still matters when it comes to marketing your business. Some would argue it\u2019s more important than ever in today\u2019s competitive landscape, especially with the burgeoning role of social media.</p><p><strong>Good Copywriting Is Invisible</strong></p><p>Well-written copy delivers your message without attracting attention to the mechanics of your sentences. If you\u2019ve ever read a poorly-written copy, you know the opposite occurs. You find you\u2019re not focused on the message but rather the awkwardness of the statement or the careless choice of words. It slows your reading pace and distracts you from the ideas you\u2019re trying to convey.</p><p><strong>What Constitutes Good Writing?</strong></p><p>Readers want you to get to the point. They\u2019re busy. They have other media competing for their attention. Make it easy and enjoyable for them to glide through your paragraphs. Good writing is simple. It\u2019s easy to understand. It lacks unnecessary complexity. The vocabulary is varied but not pretentious. Why choose a fancy, multi-syllabic word when a shorter one will do (i.e. use vs. utilize, often vs. oftentimes)? Weed out extra words to improve clarity. Get rid of redundancies, cliches and fluff. Delete energy-sapping words like: very, really, just, quite and rather. What makes writing even more interesting than its style is its substance. Focus on content over craft. Deliver your message in its purest form. Your content will pack more power and inspire a greater response.</p><p><strong>The Art of Persuasion Begins With Good Copy</strong></p><p>Think of your copy\u2013whether for an ad, brochure or website\u2013as your secret salesperson. Its job, much like a salesperson\u2019s, is to persuade the reader to buy your product or service. Be sure it will make a favorable impression, one that is consistent with your branding. In today\u2019s media-rich world, there\u2019s no shortage of messages competing for your customers\u2019 attention. You don\u2019t want to lose out because your copy is ineffective. </p><p><strong>What Skills Do You Need to ee an Effective SEO Copywriter?</strong></p><p>Of course, you need copywriting skills but beyond that you need to know how to sell. You can be the best copywriter in the world but if you\u2019re ineffective at selling, you won\u2019t succeed. You also need to understand how businesses operate. How do they make money? What is their business model? Who is their competition? How do they market their products or services? Those are all basic questions that you\u2019ll be considering for each new client you get and the answers will help inform your copywriting for that client. In addition to those skills, you need to have a desire to learn. So much of copywriting involves research and learning about your clients and their industries. If you\u2019re not naturally curious, you\u2019ll struggle as a copywriter.</p><p><strong>Why You Need Our Copywriting &amp; Content Marketing Course:</strong></p><p><em>When you enrol, you\u2019ll get Instant access to powerhouse Copywriting &amp; SEO techniques that have been proven to deliver.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Learn SEO &amp; Local SEO</strong> - SEO Fundamentals master guide and SEO Strategies that get you found! white hat SEO to max traffic, SEO Key factors and Tools that will give you an edge, PLUS our SEO On-page guide.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learn 210 SEO factors</strong> - every aspect of the SEO game covered, including Voice SEO, Video SEO, Visual SEO &amp; Local SEO, plus, get valuable keyword insight so you can optimise all your content!

That\u2019s not true. The basics of SEO are actually quite simple. And with 58% of all web traffic coming from Google, it\u2019s certainly something worth learning about if you have a website. If you think the SEO fundamentals aren\u2019t enough to get you ranked, think again. Most people running websites have a very limited understanding of SEO, so knowing the fundamentals can certainly help you succeed.</p><p><strong>What Are the Benefits of SEO?</strong></p><ul><li><p>SEO leads to more traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to consistent traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to \u2018free\u2019 traffic</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO Helps You To Rank Higher...</strong></p><p>But you can\u2019t rank higher if Google doesn\u2019t even know your website exists in the first place. Getting your website indexed by search engines means you\u2019re in the race, not that you\u2019re likely to win. That\u2019s where SEO comes in. SEO is an ongoing process that, if done well, increases your chances of winning over time. It\u2019s much easier to do SEO well when your website is properly set up for SEO success.</p><p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business. And that content needs to reach audience members in a way that feels natural and organic versus being disruptive. Content marketing helps businesses do this, and it describes the process of attracting, engaging with, and delighting your target markets.</p><p>By honing in on effective content marketing, you can do just that \u2014 and as a result, increase conversions, improve brand awareness, boost revenue, establish yourself as an industry leader, and more...</p><p><strong>Content marketing</strong> is the process of planning, creating, distributing, sharing, and publishing content to reach your target audience.

Fue primeramente introducida por la NASA en 1960 como una posible medida para detectar vida en otros planetas y como medida preventiva de contaminaci\u00f3n en el agua reciclada durante largos viajes al espacio. La Bioluminiscencia es un fen\u00f3meno natural que ocurre en muchas algas y bacterias acu\u00e1ticas, as\u00ed como en la luz producida por las luci\u00e9rnagas que se tom\u00f3 como base para evolucionar esta tecnolog\u00eda. El Adenosin Trifosfato (ATP) es un compuesto presente en todos los seres vivos, animales y plantas, incluyendo gran n\u00famero de alimentos y residuos de alimentos, bacterias, hongos y otros microorganismos.

La reacci\u00f3n se da cuando la luciferina, mol\u00e9cula responsable de la emisi\u00f3n de luz, es transformada en oxiluciferina por una enzima llamada luciferasa. La luciferasa consume ox\u00edgeno y una mol\u00e9cula de ATP, principal fuente de energ\u00eda de los seres vivos, para liberar luz a 560 nan\u00f3metros (nm).
