The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3002694", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "How to Get UpWork Clients (2020 And Beyond)", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Christine McLean", "duration": "3 hours", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "37", "students": "7847", "coupon_code": "UPGET_FREE_JAN", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3002694_7ebd_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-get-upwork-clients-2020-and-beyond/?couponCode=UPGET_FREE_JAN", "end_day": "2022-01-12 19:57:09+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to create a successful online freelancing career using UpWork through bulletproof personal branding", "description": "<p>This course is for those who are serious about taking a 360 degree approach to UpWork freelance success.

Architecture principles and clean code design in OOP applications", "description": "<p>From this course you can learn <strong>GoF Design Patterns with detailed Java examples.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses in this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn programming it is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who was recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from IT-Bulls company!

However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3989930", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Analytics & Intelligence", "title": "TIBCO Spotfire Development : Beginners To Advanced Course", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Prince Patni", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "36", "students": "10159", "coupon_code": "SPOTFIRE_JAN1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3989930_92f5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tibco-spotfire-development-beginners-to-advanced-course/?couponCode=SPOTFIRE_JAN1", "end_day": "2022-01-12 17:56:48+00:00", "headline": "Learn TIBCO Spotfire in this Fast Paced Course - Right from Basics to Advanced Topics like Expressions, Python, R etc.", "description": "<p>This <strong>TIBCO</strong> <strong>Spotfire course</strong> will help you to become a Data Visualization Expert and will enhance your BI skills by offering you comprehensive knowledge, and the required hands-on experience on this widely used BI tool, by solving real-time industry-based projects.<br></p><p><strong>Top Reasons why you should learn Tibco Spotfire : </strong></p><ul><li><p>TIBCO Spotfire is among the top Business Intelligence tools used industry wide.</p></li><li><p>The demand for BI&nbsp;professionals is on the rise.

It is the predominant technology used to drive enterprise-scale business technology. Companies have chosen .NET because for its proven scalability, reliability, and support.</p><p>The .NET language of choice to learn is C#, as it is among the most widely used languages today. It\u2019s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications. As such, there is a high demand across the world for .NET developers in a variety of industries, so that means that more jobs are available for candidates with a foundation built upon .NET technologies.</p><p><strong>About This Course</strong></p><p>In this course, you will also learn how to use Javascript, JQuery and JQueryUI and Ajax to develop dynamic and user friendly user interfaces.

The strength of PMI\u2019s certifications is that they are portable and not tied to any single method, standard or organization. PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}]}
