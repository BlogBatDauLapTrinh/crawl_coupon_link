So, if you want to create an unforgettable first impression, it is very important that you prepare yourself with the correct tools and techniques before you even go to meet the person in question whom you want to impress or go to the event/interview.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked this one question to the many decision-makers all over the world \"If you would like to see the change that will make your organization more productive, what would it be?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody came back with one word and they said ATTITUDE.

ONLY 15% depends on how intelligent they are or how many facts and figures they know.</p><p><br></p><p>And almost 100% of the education dollars go to teaching facts and figures which accounts for only 15% of the success, and what we are talking about in this course is 85%. This is what brings us to a point that it is not our position but our disposition that determines our success.</p><p>Now, once you are standing in front of the person you want to impress, you want to make sure that you connect with them on a personal as well as a professional level. Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is through the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody?

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2767208", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Other Business", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Expert Course + Live Class", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "1184", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "796", "students": "143811", "coupon_code": "9D2FA69E9C9084EF0413", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2767208_818e_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-exposed-future-10-extreme-edition/?couponCode=4C4852405999B3E7CC36", "end_day": "2022-05-07 02:04:00+00:00", "headline": "A breathtaking course in 2022 that teaches new-age Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies and Tools", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>a mind-blowing </em><strong><em>\"</em>Artificial Intelligence Expert Course<em>\" </em></strong><em>in 2022.</em></p><p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence Expert Course: Platinum Edition - </em></strong><em>The course has now launched.</em></p><p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;seems to be a unique technology for making a machine, a robot fully autonomous.

The aim of Artificial Intelligence is to enhance machine functions relating to human knowledge, such as reasoning, learning, and problems along with the ability to manipulate things. For example, virtual assistants or chatbots offer expert advice. Smart robots or robot advisors will provide instant research or findings in the fields of finance, insurance, law, the media, and journalism, and medical diagnosis and support will be provided by AI software on the health front. Other advantages include increasing productivity dramatically in research and development programs by reducing time to the market, enhancing the transport and supply chain networks and improving governance by improved decision-making processes etc.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technology is aiding the following prominent fields for 2022 and many others:</p><p>Website Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to create websites and landing pages in merely minutes.</p><p>App Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to automate the whole concept of creating apps.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) \u2212 This process is simulating the actual interaction with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.</p><p>Expert Systems \u2212 Learners and users will be provided with guided information and advice on the computer or software.</p><p>Vision Systems \u2212&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;systems in 2022 can understand, explain and describe the computer's visual input to the ultimate core.</p><p>Spoken Word or Speech Recognition \u2212 Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based speech recognition systems are capable of listening, voicing and recognizing the user input - i.e. when a person speaks with them. Alexa, Siri and Google's assistant, are examples of this function. </p><p>Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help users to create and experiment with machine learning models and build data science applications in a flash. </p><p>Video Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate video production and cut high costs of hiring resources and teams as everything is taken care of in the cloud. </p><p>Python and Coding tools - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate writing lakhs of lines of code in python and even Java or PHP&nbsp;in minutes without the need for a human coder or even someone who will debug the code.

The impact of <strong><em>avatars</em></strong> on education is simply incredible. <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>-guided programs allow <strong><em>teachers like you</em></strong> to train in a <strong><em>virtual</em></strong> classroom.</p><p><strong>What's having an avatar all about?</strong></p><p>An avatar is a figure or character that can be created and customized using cloud-based tools. Avatars can be used for teacher training. Instructional coaches use a virtual classroom to train teachers by helping them master strategies such as questioning at a higher level or managing behaviour. Avatars imitate different types of students to help teachers practice classroom management and relate to their students. The trainee teachers stand in front of a projection screen on which they see avatars that are being controlled, or acted out, by actual students trained to behave a certain way. </p><p>Avatar-guided programs allow teachers to train before real students in a virtual classroom without the risk of making mistakes.&nbsp;Also, creating 3D&nbsp;trainer avatar characters across a school has initial start-up costs as well as fixed and variable costs that can be reduced as the software program is used over time. </p><p>This mind-blowing course teaches you some tools - even apps to create avatars in 2D&nbsp;or 3D for educational or instructional use in your classroom.&nbsp;We will also glance at a real-time 3D&nbsp;animation tool to speed up the animation process to create faster avatar animation - without any technical skills required from your end. </p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Impact on student learning studies conducted by the top universities in the world found that instructor applicants have changed the way they work in the classroom following four 10-minute sessions using avatar-powered platforms like VOKI. <em>Look at the first lecture to understand how to use the VOKI platform.</em></p><p>Students feel more engaged and enthusiastic by imitating the layout of campus and classrooms, even if they learn independently at home. This concept of immersive environments applies not only to universities but also to all kinds of online learning; it allows students to be part of a particular environment rather than feel like they are learning in isolation.</p><p>Avatars increase confidence in information sources, according to a Stanford study, and research shows that when characters guide interactions, people trust the information more than in identical, character-free interactions.</p><p>So, enrol now, there is a lot more to discover here in this course about Robot Teachers or what we call 'Avatars'.</p><p><strong><em>What are you waiting for? There is no time to waste.</em></strong></p><p>There are no technical skills required to learn this course. Nevertheless, the use of cloud-based animation tools and software taught in the course that meets your requirements may be procured by you (if you need) for specific purposes of your choice.</p><p><strong>Let's get busy and start changing your teaching or animation career and life, one step at a time.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2288849", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Analytics & Intelligence", "title": "Tableau: Empieza desde cero", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Ra\u00fal Montesinos", "duration": "101", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "518", "students": "50119", "coupon_code": "9D2FA69E9C9084EF0413", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2288849_5725_9.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau-10-desde-cero/?couponCode=3A99294A0FC851A4EB12", "end_day": "2022-05-02 16:05:00+00:00", "headline": "Entra al mundo del business intelligence y aprende a visualizar grandes cantidades de informaci\u00f3n.", "description": "<p><strong>\u00a1Vu\u00e9lvete un experto en el Business Intelligence con TableauI!</strong></p><p>Si eres un estudiante o profesionista que quiere<strong> potenciar su carrera profesional </strong>te tengo una buena noticia:</p><p><strong>\u00a1Encontraste el curso indicado!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u00bfSientes que tu carrera profesional esta <strong>estancada</strong>?</p><p>\u00bf<strong>Tu perfil no destaca</strong> entre el de los dem\u00e1s?</p><p>\u00bfSientes que en la escuela<strong> no aprendiste nada \u00fatil</strong> para el mundo laboral?</p><p>\u00bf<strong>Crees que Excel es la \u00fanica herramienta</strong> para analizar datos y hacer gr\u00e1ficas?</p><p>\u00bfYa sabes Power BI pero quieres <strong>llevarlo al siguiente nivel</strong>?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>No tener las habilidades correctas </strong>para esta nueva era tecnol\u00f3gica es la ra\u00edz de todos estos males.</p><p>Actualmente<strong> el mundo est\u00e1 lleno de datos</strong> y es fundamental saber como <strong>analizarlos y presentarlos para extraer valor </strong>de ellos.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.

Frankly speaking, it was his marketing genius that set him and his company apart from everybody else on the planet. Now, I would like to re-incarnate Walt Disney into this course and put forth ideas from his perspective, imagining him to be your business coach, after all. What ideas Walt Disney would bring to your table if he lived now?</p><p>Yes, truly it started with a mouse and marketing - in the beginning.</p><p>Walt Disney may have created Mickey Mouse - but none of his success would have been possible without his marketing ingenuity. With the genius in him, he filled up movie theatres, theme parks and sold tons of Disney merchandise. Without Disney, there would be no Disney World and no family entertainment parks. He was the marketing genius for the 20th century!</p><p>While Disney went a bit overboard with his marketing, it's not like he didn't have some great ideas though. Walt Disney had amazing visions, but he was never very good at verbalising them. </p><p>Before that, think of all the big concepts created and promoted today through successful marketing. You should have the mantra that should be branded with your company. Let's take \"Think Different as an example of Apple Inc.\" First introduced in 1997 with this slogan, Apple has transformed into a multimillion-dollar business. The idea is simply to break away from conventional thinking and adapt to technology, customer needs and competition.</p><p>You have all these new ideas in your business, but how do you communicate them to the world? You need an ad campaign to get your idea out there too to reach the masses. Now, let's talk about how this course can be a differentiator when it comes to innovation and thinking like Walt&nbsp;Disney.</p><p><strong>Why enrol for this mind-blowing course \"Innovation 1.0\" that has the power to change the world of innovation forever?</strong></p><p>Your content marketing campaign is vital to the success of your organisation. You will know that the way you present your company's brand shapes people's views of your organisation. Times may have changed since Walt Disney's days but his marketing ideas are still an element of brilliance. Let's take a look at a few tactics from Walt Disney\u2019s angle to push your business idea to success.)</p><p>In the superb course, you will learn how Walt Disney would think about any idea about a product/service. We will be focussing on Disney\u2019s creative strategy which has the root cause of the success of the company and of course, Walt Disney, the man, the myth and the legend - himself.</p><p>I guarantee that this course is unlike any course you\u2019ve ever taken. It definitely helps in showcasing the most fantastic and absurd ideas possible from Disney\u2019s perspective and also focuses on how you can apply the same principles of Walt Disney to enjoy renewed and continuous business success.</p><p><strong>Welcome to My Class and Evoke the Brilliance of Disney</strong></p><p>Enrol now.

Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously.

And thanx a lot for sharing your knowledge!\"&nbsp;Sergey</em></p><p><strong>Dearest Student,</strong></p><p>Hi, it's Tomas Moravek here, Internet Efficiency Awarded digital strategist, with my Facebook Dynamic Ads Mastery, the most comprehensive course currently available that teaches how to unlock the power of Facebook Dynamic Ads using Dynamic Retargeting.</p><p><strong>This Course Will Walk You Through Everything You Need To Know To Master Dynamic Ads.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>It includes my insider knowledge, real world case blueprints, worksheets, To Do Lists, and video explainers on Dynamic Ads, retargeting, remarketing, cataloguing, and the Facebook Business Manager, and features in-depth guides to Facebook Pixel Events and a complete blueprint guide to setting up different events with the Facebook Pixel Event Tool.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Advertising Is A Powerfully Effective Way To Boost Your Sales</strong> as it uses smart tech and intuitive AI algorithms to put the right products in front of users who are ready to purchase. Even if they haven\u2019t visited your website or browsed your app before, if they\u2019re opted into ad personalisation you can target them and convert browsers into buyers by matching the right products to the right people.</p><p>This method works so well, as by personalising the pitch you <em>massively</em> increase your chances of making a sale. You then can continue to retarget potential customers by sending personalised ad \u201creminders\u201d that encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads Can Be Used To Promote The Products And Services Of:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ecommerce websites</strong> \u2013 Match the preferences of your browsers and sell more</p></li><li><p><strong>Real estate brokers or listings</strong> \u2013 Target people looking to buy or sell property</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel companies</strong> \u2013 Match people\u2019s previous travel searches with your relevant ads</p></li><li><p><strong>Automotive brands</strong> \u2013 Sell your vehicles faster by laser focusing on interested buyers</p></li><li><p><em>And more!</em> Market anything using this highly targeted form of advertising!!</p></li></ul><p><strong>With My Course, You'll Unleash The Full Power Of Facebook Dynamic Ads So You Can Automatically Display Laser Targeted Products To Your Website Visitors Or App Users Who\u2019ve Previously Expressed An Interest In Your Business.</strong></p><p>You <em>do</em> need a basic grounding in Facebook Business and Facebook Ads before you study with me on this course, so if you don't have that, I'd recommend starting with one of my comprehensive Facebook Marketing courses for total beginners.</p><p>However, if you have the basics in place, and now want to master Facebook Dynamic Ads, this course will teach you everything you need to know.</p><p>To get started you\u2019ll need to set up Facebook Pixel on your website, which I\u2019ll guide you through. This is because Dynamic Ads work best when there is a strong feedback loop between your online product catalogue and your ads. Optionally, if you have an app, you can increase installs by showing relevant ads that direct people to download, and for this you\u2019ll need to install the Facebook SDK.</p><p>As Dynamic Ads work on a large scale, you\u2019ll require a Facebook Business Manager account and uploaded product catalogue. I will teach you how to correctly set up your Business Manager account <em>and</em> create and upload your product catalogue, so you can get started with Dynamic Ads right away. If you have a website powered by Shopify, Magento, or BigCommerce, you don\u2019t need to create a catalogue, so you can skip this step.</p><p>It's easy to learn using my method, as I've taken care to lay out everything clearly for you. Using step by step best practice guides, high quality video explainers, worksheets, and To Do Lists, you'll be able to expand your skillset and quickly build your Dynamic Ads knowledge.</p><p>Using real world case blueprints, and a wide variety of high performing Facebook traffic ad samples, covering a <em>multitude</em> of sectors, I\u2019ll lay out in-depth Every successful remarketing and retargeting strategy that\u2019s possible using Facebook Dynamic Ads.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be giving away my powerful in-depth guide to creating custom and lookalike audiences so you can get maximum mileage from your retargeting and remarketing efforts. This is the MOST comprehensive course currently available that covers remarketing, retargeting, custom and lookalike audiences, Dynamic Ads, the Facebook Pixel, Facebook Pixel Events, and the Facebook Pixel Event Helper and includes all my best practice guides, blueprints, case studies, walkthroughs, video explainers, worksheets, To Do Lists and so much more!</p><p>I've invested so much of my time and effort into putting together this course and I\u2019m excited to share it with you.

The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.</p><p>One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it.

The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!
