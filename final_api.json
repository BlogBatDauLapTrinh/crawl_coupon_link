You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Created and still published by Harcourt Assessment (now a division of Pearson Education), the MAT consists of 120 questions in 60 minutes (formerly 100 questions in 50 minutes). Unlike other graduate school admissions exams such as the GRE, the Miller Analogies Test is verbal or computer based</p><p>The <strong>Miller Analogies Test</strong> (<strong>MAT</strong>) is an exam administered by the Harcourt Assessment at Pearson testing center. The MAT is an admissions exam accepted by many graduate programs in the United States. Additionally, it is used by many high-IQ societies all over the world as an admission requirement. The MAT goal is to assess logical and analytical reasoning through completion of partial analogies. The test duration is 1 hour and contains 120 questions. Exam formats include both <strong>Computer-Based Tests (CBT)</strong> and paper and pencil format.</p><p>This free practice exam features realistic questions that will help you not only review key vocabulary, but also familiarize yourself with the MAT\u2019s 120 Analogy exam format. This exam is also very good preparation for those preparing for the GRE Test, as both exams cover analogies.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>The MAT is a one hundred item, fifty minute verbal analogies test. All of the questions will be in the form of A:B:C:D. The analogies are written so that A is to B as C is to D. However, your job will be to fill in the missing term by correctly identifying the relationship that exists.</p><p><strong>Test Centers, Dates, and Fees</strong></p><p>Currently, there are more than six hundred testing centers in fifty states as well as in several foreign countries. If you live more than one hundred miles away from a designated test center, special accommodations can be made. Dates will vary by testing site, so be sure to consult with the test site. The average fee to take the MAT is about $50, though that varies by region.</p><p><strong>Scores</strong></p><p>When you register to take the MAT, you are asked to provide up to three addresses that you wish to have your score reports sent. Sending your test scores to three schools is included in the test administration fee. However, it is your responsibility to provide accurate addresses for the schools.</p><p><strong>History of the MAT</strong></p><p>According to the Miller Analogies Test Manual (1970) the test was developed to measure scholastic aptitude at the graduate school level. It is also developed to measure how well the test taker can recognize relationships between words.</p><p>Vocabulary plays a very important role on this test. Before you can correctly identify the relationship that exists between the words, you must be able to recognize and comprehend the meaning of the answer choices. Often, it is not reasoning that makes test items difficult. Rather, it is in recognizing the answer choices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Smarter not harder</em></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3161726", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Productivity", "title": "Learn To Focus: Meditation & Mindfulness For ADHD", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Kevin Ellerton", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "363", "students": "54731", "coupon_code": "CAD918A187E6667B37D3", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3161726_8bc7_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/meditation-for-adhd/?couponCode=CAD918A187E6667B37D3", "end_day": "2021-11-23 19:11:15+00:00", "headline": "Don't \"cure\" your ADHD - transform it into a superpower!", "description": "<p>ADD and ADHD can make it hard to focus &amp; get things done. You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2019-06-18_12-59-58-03caeadbd0fd28015868d7836c8261f8/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637420767&Signature=doFPh4j4HVuFE1p1AvArBhL-UGTvV565rOZ20gcVDZMtEkgB6W0XXSLsLC0gaQ9TrvZu-nMPFhGDYVjN7KZdH0-yd3VtYhhwTCeQL98VsR5McOILtP7I4mHqyLHYlbEtgB6Dsqvlm-M4OhjrHRuRjSZAOljhWQ2syqM0ZvBR96Ke2-4BG39Oclv~f7MSt9KUKXkbtKEGNkGZCKcP8EvDay5w26v4~OSBASzUKy~~CJg~HOeQGelnomIfqk9g2ygmDLYH4SxNgNN3qfUSaI0J-gi8GWRlH6-8lGjifX7z698H4bXtCYUTUu8Byl3jfd0nN~VppIhYJlOSjmXZymC8oQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4400518", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Programming Languages", "title": "Learn PyQt5 From Basics to Real World Projects", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Hadi youness", "duration": "6 hours", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "379", "coupon_code": "9BFEA286609079C0F3CA", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4400518_3aec_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-pyqt5-from-basics-to-real-world-projects/?couponCode=9BFEA286609079C0F3CA", "end_day": "2021-11-25 07:20:29+00:00", "headline": "Create Real-World Applications With Python's Most Famous", "description": "<p>In this course, you are going to learn about python's most famous graphical user interface:&nbsp;PyQt5. </p><p>We are going to follow the following outline:&nbsp;</p><p>-First, we are going to learn about the basic widget of PyQt5 such as the layout, label, buttons, bars, and much more.</p><p>-Second, we are going to move into some advanced widgets and topics such as input, font, and file dialog, stacks, tabs, and splitters. </p><p>-Then, we are going to learn about PyQt's famous tool \"Qt Designer\" which is going to allow to the creation of an application using the drag and drop technique.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure environment and make tests work, especially in case student didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement.

Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation of the each lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

Finish your Udemy course and Contact us to get your Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Certificate!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Membership Sites Are Perfect For Passive Income?</strong><br></p><p>If you\u2019re interested in making money online, then it\u2019s probably because you&nbsp;like the idea of having more freedom to live and work wherever and&nbsp;however you want. The benefits of working online are many and varied and\nextend into every aspect of your life.</p><p>But in order for you to make the very most from this way of working, you&nbsp;also need to make sure you choose the perfect business model. Working&nbsp;online on its own does not necessarily equate to an ideal lifestyle; rather\nthe benefits come when you work online in the right way. And let me tell&nbsp;you: creating a membership site is definitely the right way.</p><p> Working online is easy. If you are in a job that\u2019s fairly flexible, then you&nbsp;should be able to ask your employer if you can work from home and simply&nbsp;log into the company\u2019s network whenever you start working. And sure, this will bring some benefits: you\u2019ll be able to stay in bed longer and stop commuting and you\u2019ll have the luxury of&nbsp;being able to drink tea, listen to&nbsp;music and generally create a comfortable environment.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>But you\u2019re still ultimately a slave to your job. You\u2019re still trading \u2018time for&nbsp;hours\u2019 and you\u2019ll still need to be available for the hours between 9am-5pm. </p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019ll probably also need to be near the phone and you\u2019ll be expected to&nbsp;output a certain amount of work every day. That means you probably can\u2019t&nbsp;leave the house and work outdoors in case you lose your internet&nbsp;connection. And it means you can decide to stop working for the day and&nbsp;visit a friend instead. Worst of all, you can still be \u2018told off\u2019 by your boss \u2013&nbsp;reprimanded like a child! </p><p><br></p><p>The same goes for creating your own online business. If you\u2019re a web&nbsp;designer for example, then you have the freedom to decide when you work&nbsp;on projects. But you probably still have deadlines and to all extents and&nbsp;purposes, your clients are your bosses. If you fail to complete </p><p> </p><p>This is why so many people find the idea of blogging desirable. All you&nbsp;have to do is to create and manage a website that you hopefully find&nbsp;fascinating and really enjoy writing about. You\u2019ll get to experience a lot of the satisfaction that comes from running your own business. And you get&nbsp;passive income, meaning that you\u2019ll earn money while you sleep.&nbsp;But even this isn\u2019t perfect. Because one day, you might earn $200 and the&nbsp;next day you might earn $10.</p><p>\nIt only takes a change to Google\u2019s search algorithm and you can lose all of&nbsp;your progress. What\u2019s more, is that it takes actually a huge amount of time&nbsp;to build up the amount of traffic that you need to make a big profit from a&nbsp;blog. This is especially true if you are planning to use pay-per-click&nbsp;advertising but it\u2019s equally the case if you are selling your own product.</p><p>\nThink about it: how often do you click ads on other websites? This is why it&nbsp;typically takes 1K visitors for you to generate just one or two clicks and the&nbsp;same goes for sales of products. It\u2019s a huge amount of work before you&nbsp;start earning anything and there\u2019s no guarantee it will ever get to the point&nbsp;where it can provide a livable salary.</p><p><br></p><p>Enter: Recurring, Passive Income</p><p>This is where membership site come in and offer an incredibly appealing alternative. Essentially, a membership website is a site that users pay to subscribe to. This normally works by first enticing the reader with some free content and showing them the kind of entertainment/information/value that you\u2019re capable of providing. Once they\u2019re hooked, you then make sure they know that they need to subscribe in order to gain access to your very best content and to get frequently updated.</p><p><br></p><p>So what\u2019s so different about this? Well for starters, it means that you can&nbsp;much more easily convert visitors to paying customers seeing as they\u2019re&nbsp;not having to put down a large amount of money and seeing as they know&nbsp;what they\u2019re getting right away.</p><p><br></p><p>More importantly, though, it means that the money is recurring and much&nbsp;more predictable. Unlike a regular blog that can very much fluctuate,&nbsp;having subscribers means you probably have some kind of agreement or&nbsp;standing order set up. This means that you can practically guarantee that&nbsp;you\u2019ll be able to earn a set amount of money each week, month or quarter.</p><p><br></p><p>And that very quickly starts to add up\u2026</p><p>So say you currently have people subscribing for $5 membership a month. If your&nbsp;content is good, then you could realistically convince one in every 1-10,000&nbsp;people to sign up. But it\u2019s very possible the very first person who visits&nbsp;might sign up! There\u2019s an element of luck but as soon as you get that first&nbsp;membership you\u2019re in business \u2013 and $5 membership a month quickly adds up to $60 a&nbsp;year.</p><p><br></p><p>Eventually, you can work whenever you like and add as much content as&nbsp;you like (we\u2019ll look at how later on) and&nbsp;still know for sure that you\u2019ll be able&nbsp;to earn X amount of money per month and per year. This is very much&nbsp;living the dream \u2013 all the freedom of passive incomes but with all the&nbsp;security of a well-paid job!</p><p>Can people unsubscribe? Sure they can! But the likelihood of everyone&nbsp;unsubscribing all at once is incredibly&nbsp;slim and in most cases you\u2019ll have&nbsp;more new visitors signing up than old visitors leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>What You Will Learn</p><p>This course is going to explain in great detail exactly how you go about creating your own membership website.</p><p>We\u2019ll see how to build a membership website, how to make sure that people want to subscribe, how to implement a recurring&nbsp;fee and how to thrive in this market space.</p><p>What we\u2019ll also see is that there are multiple membership business models that can work online when you know&nbsp;how.</p><p>We\u2019ll look at a selection so that you can decide on the perfect type of membership site/content for you.</p><p>Ultimately, we\u2019re going to give you the tools to take the subjects that you love and then turn them into a stable&nbsp;source of income that will pay out even while you\u2019re sleeping.</p><p>Specifically, you will learn:\n</p><p>\uf0b7 How to create a membership website or blog</p><p>\uf0b7 How to turn your site into a membership site&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to make content that will make people want to subscribe&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to promote your membership&nbsp; site&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to price your membership site&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to add extra monetization to your offering&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to create a membership app&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to create membership video&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 The importance of building a community&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 How to use quizzes and other forms of media&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 What you can learn from the best membership sites&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 The strategies and tools you can learn to succeed even beyond those\u2026&nbsp;</p><p>\uf0b7 And much more!</p><p><strong>Kindly note that this is a 100% informational guide, there are no \u201cOn-Screen how to steps\u201d.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2016-12-24_12-57-42-e98998c703aed41168dcccdfc0c5da5e/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637420810&Signature=cSQq36rXHYD3OeUf7Rav532poAW0UUUZm5lx3hw~K3Mh9uoWWFvuhJeHA8ZhEYJotbvvtlIQYw0ge-ynqWtoI-LzI5goI6dOWsizzodfSGYZgrrkGzuzcC9uM-QAFJdFSKZdqVltdWj5MAR72iphOw1bThmzd0-CpT46VOP8ffu8vjhAiK3hHKU77U1s6Vuc7dzXlx4V4VjdNUl75cO9izVE0KiksmIUwfBPemIWh2f~RNIOggnpcZ-G75eYK9LMGRhk0-gJAj6uxTn-XLLKdSEV~eVdL~PZWD1OQkfMKA8YRj4CfGfRtOa3N~e2dBcMbDoWISNm6RwSrOmrYDGzsQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2880878", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Shopify Bootcamp: Increase Your Sales and Conversion rate", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yassin Marco", "duration": "1.5 hours", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "108", "students": "50833", "coupon_code": "4D280B33973B1984A0E0", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2880878_139c.jpg?secure=oufTXaPNShoJMGCXJbgVFw%3D%3D%2C1637491012", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/shopify-bootcamp-increase-your-sales-and-conversion-rate/?couponCode=4D280B33973B1984A0E0", "end_day": "2021-11-25 03:52:00+00:00", "headline": "Shopify for beginners: Boost your conversion rate/sales with shopify.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. Beside that all topics are presented on real-life examples - this help grasp knowledge faster.</p><p>One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is implementation of backend system for online store. Also you have a lot of tasks that use domain specific terminology:&nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain specific terminology and during the lessons we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you clear vision how you can apply the knowledge in real life.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the hometask solutions and source code of examples which were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructor's availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, instructor teaches framework which is not used already for 15 years. Or instructor do a stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>Instructor of this course is consultant in the top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from the one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interview in company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed application to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>Instructor of this course come up with hundreds tests which are used to test knowledge of candidates. With this application you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course we will tell you how to set up special bonus code which will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson - instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

It takes courage, endeavor and commitment<br>to live in a new country and participate fully as a citizen. We value your contribution to our peaceful and<br>democratic society. Australian citizenship is an important step in your migration story.</p><p>The <strong>Australian citizenship test</strong> plays a valuable role in encouraging people to find out more about Australia, as well as understanding the responsibilities and privileges being an Australian citizen brings. All the information you need to pass the test is in the citizenship test resource Australian Citizenship: Our Common Bond.</p><p><br></p><p>About Australia Citizenship Practice Test:</p><p>\u2013 The test is in English<br>\u2013 consists of 20 multiple choice questions, and<br>\u2013 You must answer %75 of the questions correct in order to pass.<br>\u2013 There is not a separate English language test but you will need a basic knowledge of English to pass the test.</p><p>Before you can set the citizenship test, you must apply for citizenship. Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4401607", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Online Education", "title":

This course will show you how to leverage MVC's Scaffolding features to quickly construct data driven html pages and how to write queries to the database using .NET's famed Entity Framework with C#. </p><p><strong>UPDATED CONTENT </strong></p><p>.NET Framework is nearing end of support from Microsoft. <strong>.NET 6 </strong>is the latest technology and learning it is made available to you through my course <strong>Complete ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Development. </strong></p><p><strong>Why Learn .NET&nbsp;MVC</strong></p><p>Microsoft .NET is the platform that drives the business technology of many of the top corporations in the United States and many other countries. It is the predominant technology used to drive enterprise-scale business technology. Companies have chosen .NET because for its proven scalability, reliability, and support.</p><p>The .NET language of choice to learn is C#, as it is among the most widely used languages today. It\u2019s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications. As such, there is a high demand across the world for .NET developers in a variety of industries, so that means that more jobs are available for candidates with a foundation built upon .NET technologies.</p><p><strong>About This Course</strong></p><p>In this course, you will also learn how to use Javascript, JQuery and JQueryUI and Ajax to develop dynamic and user friendly user interfaces. All interfaces will be keenly styled using the standard Bootstrap CSS Framework, which is used to maintain a standard look and feel across all pages. </p><p><strong>At the end of this course, you should be able to: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Build a fully data driven web application</p></li><li><p>Understand the MVC Folder Structure</p></li><li><p>Add Data models to your project using Entity Framework</p></li><li><p>Write basic LINQ queries</p></li><li><p>Understand how Models, Views and Controllers combine to facilitate a web application</p></li><li><p>Understand Razor Syntax in views </p></li><li><p>Understand C#&nbsp;Model Classes</p></li><li><p>Understand how to add views and actions to a controller</p></li><li><p>Use Bootstrap to insert JavaScript controls (sliders, etc), button and text styles and manipulate the overall layout</p></li><li><p>Upload a project to GitHub</p></li><li><p>Manage Packages in an MVC Project</p></li><li><p>User JQuery and tools to increase interactivity and animations on the interface.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>To take this course, you will need to have some knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, if not C#. Even if you do not have much exposure to the .NET development stack, this course is very beginner friendly and chock full of development tips. </p><p>This course has over 6 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each module in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.</p><p>By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio and examined logic and syntax errors so much, that it will be second nature for you when working in the .NET environment. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and <strong>impress your boss and coworkers</strong>.</p><p>The course is <strong>complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated</strong>.

It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way.
