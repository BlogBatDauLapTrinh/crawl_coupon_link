converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called <em>digital representation</em> or, more specifically, a <em>digital image</em>, for the object, and <em>digital form</em>, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitate processing by digital computers and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.</p><p>Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\". Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organizations around the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Haytham H.

The impact of <strong><em>avatars</em></strong> on education is simply incredible. <strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>-guided programs allow <strong><em>teachers like you</em></strong> to train in a <strong><em>virtual</em></strong> classroom.</p><p><strong>What's having an avatar all about?</strong></p><p>An avatar is a figure or character that can be created and customized using cloud-based tools. Avatars can be used for teacher training. Instructional coaches use a virtual classroom to train teachers by helping them master strategies such as questioning at a higher level or managing behaviour. Avatars imitate different types of students to help teachers practice classroom management and relate to their students. The trainee teachers stand in front of a projection screen on which they see avatars that are being controlled, or acted out, by actual students trained to behave a certain way. </p><p>Avatar-guided programs allow teachers to train before real students in a virtual classroom without the risk of making mistakes.&nbsp;Also, creating 3D&nbsp;trainer avatar characters across a school has initial start-up costs as well as fixed and variable costs that can be reduced as the software program is used over time. </p><p>This mind-blowing course teaches you some tools - even apps to create avatars in 2D&nbsp;or 3D for educational or instructional use in your classroom.&nbsp;We will also glance at a real-time 3D&nbsp;animation tool to speed up the animation process to create faster avatar animation - without any technical skills required from your end. </p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Impact on student learning studies conducted by the top universities in the world found that instructor applicants have changed the way they work in the classroom following four 10-minute sessions using avatar-powered platforms like VOKI. <em>Look at the first lecture to understand how to use the VOKI platform.</em></p><p>Students feel more engaged and enthusiastic by imitating the layout of campus and classrooms, even if they learn independently at home. This concept of immersive environments applies not only to universities but also to all kinds of online learning; it allows students to be part of a particular environment rather than feel like they are learning in isolation.</p><p>Avatars increase confidence in information sources, according to a Stanford study, and research shows that when characters guide interactions, people trust the information more than in identical, character-free interactions.</p><p>So, enrol now, there is a lot more to discover here in this course about Robot Teachers or what we call 'Avatars'.</p><p><strong><em>What are you waiting for? There is no time to waste.</em></strong></p><p>There are no technical skills required to learn this course.

It assumes that you're new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Master the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts</p></li><li><p>Learn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects</p></li><li><p>Discover how to work with lists and sequence data</p></li><li><p>Write Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse</p></li><li><p>Use Javascript to read and write files</p></li><li><p>Make their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly</p></li><li><p>Search text using regular expressions</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The topics covered in this course are:</p><p><strong><em>*</em></strong><em> javascript course contents:</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript introduction</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript array</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript variables</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript functions</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript objects</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript control statements</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript cookies</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript loop statements</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript data structures</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript error handling</em></p></li><li><p><em>Javascript regular expressions</em></p><p><br></p><p><br><em>section 4- learn PHP&nbsp;programming language</em></p><p>This section will learn the basic structure of a web application and how a web browser interacts with a web server.

Fast forward to the future after 31 years, it is now the most commonly used program for creating graphs and pivot tables. However, many still believe it is just a mere tool for small business purposes. That\u2019s WRONG! Today, we are going to look at some of the major important purposes MS Excel is most used for. So, let\u2019s start!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Easy Arithmetic Solutions</strong><br>Perhaps the most important use of MS Excel is using its ability of mass arithmetic calculations. With a vast program full of formulae, it can add, subtract, multiply and divide hundreds of numbers altogether, and can easily re-do it if a value is changed or added. This feature can be used to easily make a company\u2019s yearly sales and other spreadsheets.</p><p><strong>Formatting Options</strong><br>The various formatting options, including italics, highlighting, and colors, allow businesses to bring the most important data to be different from the rest. A number of tasks achieved through this tool are beyond impressive, with entire row highlighting and comparing lists and values to name a few. You can use them to highlight specific entries in Accounting.</p><p><strong>Availability of Online Access</strong><br>Excel is part of the Office 365 Productivity Suite, Which means that business employers and their employees can easily access their files over the cloud network, free from the bondages of file transfer. Using a web-enabled PC, mobile or tablet, you can use the same program and access the same file remotely, making it easy to do changes if you can\u2019t access your PC and need to send the spreadsheet immediately!</p><p><strong>Charts for Analysis</strong><br>If you are working in a large association where the boss wants the detailed visual representation of the various sectors of the business, you\u2019ll need to draw charts. MS Excel makes it easy to do so! After filtering and correctly inputting data, you can turn it into a Pie Chart or Clustered Columns with a single click. Even better, it allows you to customize the colors and boundaries of the charts and pie diagrams!</p><p><strong>Bring all the data in one place</strong><br>Containing over 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns each in the spreadsheet, with hundreds of them, or even more if your PC is capable, in a single file, Excel allows you to create spreadsheets bigger than 20 A1 papers!

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

In this course, you will learn how to boost your imagination, accelerate your creativity, and make your ideas happen! The unique method consists of mind, strategy, and design actions that allow you to convert ideas into reality.</p><p>SOUZOU is a method developed by Masaaki Hasegawa using scientific findings. It is designed to boost your imagination, develop strategies, and identify concrete steps to make ideas happen. In the course, you will also learn how to maximize your performance. It is not a theory that Masaaki and a number of people have applied to their lives.</p><p>SOUZOU will allow you to boost your imagination, accelerate your creativity, and make your ideas happen. You will learn step by step how your mind works, how to develop strategies to increase the probability of making your ideas happen, and how to design actions in order to convert your ideas into reality. To implement the method effectively, this course also helps you understand how you can boost your performance to accelerate the process of conceiving ideas to converting them into reality. All the creative and innovative ideas come from imagination, and thus the key to boosting your creativity is liberating your imagination to be able to imagine something that does not exist in the present reality. You will learn how to remove the limits you have in your imagination to boost it. Then, to realize your idea, you almost always have to work with limited resources such as time, money, and people. That is why creativity in the execution is embedded into connecting dots differently, or more precisely, finding connections among irrelevant things. This course will share how to break the patterns of your thought and behavior that you can generate more creative approaches to make your ideas happen.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-06-09_11-29-24-a0f073284df819ab6fa3ee2c2ab67909/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637912482&Signature=TAv~NXvdw0PUEYXkVey4E55F5ieB2G-1h4nd~aWGrSBlhT1tXdnILgJHq-vf6VK22r0f2-zrNwluMj29ROw7G67tJgj2YmgrQwvQqAdwsYIqRobARWApdBH-K6ls7aol77ZSCVvmXpvqOaTAnvgaoV1OAy2JNC09b3UTB2WC3zp2fGHL31hSIs6F-ohhnzbesSlB4aC~-4Sf3ybNsRBm4-WYEzHFGZiBYCvzlpq0u~JToiw8x-AxL0ue5veXveZqYkl00~9fBHt2lM853lWh8IudHOnwEwJPJ1PFH~sNMTI-v5H1udVWQpChcxaN6YvQK-kuLwoL2VTQfFR~OuOyoA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3941854", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "\u00a1Curso Profesional Excel 2021\u2013 Para Empresas!", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "David Godeau", "duration": "8,5 horas", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "673", "students": "35169", "coupon_code": "BLACKFRIDAY-YES", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3941854_0c26_12.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2021-curso-profesional-excel-para-empresas/?couponCode=BLACKFRIDAY-YES", "end_day": "2021-11-30 18:34:12+00:00", "headline": "Adquiere Conocimientos Indispensables de Excel en el Mundo Empresarial. \u00a1El Curso Excel M\u00e1s Actualizado Este 2021!\u2b50", "description": "<p>El curso te proporciona los <strong>cimientos que todo Profesional Excel debe poseer</strong>.

I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part).
