This is the course for you!", "description": "<p>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.</p><p>Tim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is <em>meditation</em>. Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is <em>Meditation For Beginners</em>. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice.&nbsp;All within about an hour and a half of course materials.&nbsp;Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>Namaste.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-06-12_17-02-35-ab7f9af42549a18ab10e0e3367da1f98/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1640362452&Signature=bqKKicfxY~9AdxdvAB4IFlkKp3pw1ouIhDxu77yUQtXlfNUwV6dJBPYhPgNO6OSldWDgemJsQrEYXVRmoGciwht3KtKN0OM5R5ccZP3P-Zdvs-hBFUT8hewHxcPmSKDmOO2lilMIJwSaLD9sgdHz5NkjUsUybp40qfnpPK9GjEqaiQ8FRQI9Ka7hPwgGOeOR3RWTrQdUUxl0OTGp8BA9v~bK16CrYtqm585ISy1klfqJjXDAvqNz8PYo75ybD9zVwNx7EesgWOWCFcfuv70lmL3hOf5IFvxy~7p4OQNmDGQAhjn7SXIrTsH9-wXCFCdxWDsegd29pFYVGdO8O9P61A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4446124", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Transformation", "title": "Ebay Dropshipping E\u011fitim Kamp\u0131 - Okyanusi \u00dcniversitesi", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Okyanusi University", "duration": "3 saat", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "4", "students": "843", "coupon_code": "E59A78E89A9B1CBE3045", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4446124_9eab_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/ebay-dropshipping-egitim-kamp-okyanusi-universitesi/?couponCode=E59A78E89A9B1CBE3045", "end_day": "2021-12-25 09:00:12+00:00", "headline": "Ebay Platformunda ba\u015far\u0131l\u0131 bir sat\u0131c\u0131 olmak i\u00e7in yolculu\u011funuza h\u0131zl\u0131 bir ba\u015flang\u0131\u00e7 \u200b\u200byapman\u0131n temellerini \u00f6\u011frenin.", "description": "<p>Ebay Dropshipping E\u011fitim Kamp\u0131 - Okyanusi \u00dcniversitesi ile Patron gibi sat\u0131\u015f yapmaya ba\u015flay\u0131n.</p><p><br></p><p>2021 \u0130\u00e7in&nbsp; Yepyeni Taze Malzeme Bu Kurs Yenilenmi\u015ftir Ve Daha da Ba\u015far\u0131l\u0131 Olacaks\u0131n\u0131z.</p><p>Kendi i\u015finizi kurmak ve kendi i\u015finizin patronu olmak istiyorsan\u0131z bu dersi al\u0131n. eBay, \u00f6nce kendi e\u015fyalar\u0131n\u0131z\u0131 satarak ba\u015flay\u0131p daha sonra ba\u015fka \u00fcr\u00fcnlere ge\u00e7meniz durumunda, \u00e7ok fazla masrafa gerek duymadan bug\u00fcn \u0130nternetten para kazanmaya ba\u015flaman\u0131n en ucuz ve en h\u0131zl\u0131 yolunu sunar.

You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames, passwords,\u00a0credit cards and other sensitive\u00a0information.\u00a0<br><br>In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive, and eventually highlighted in red, bold colors on the address bar.\u00a0<br><br>It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time, money and energy to drive traffic to your website.
