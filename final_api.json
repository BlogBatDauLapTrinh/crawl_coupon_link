We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.</p><p>The basics taught in this part will be fundamental in learning time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques on later part of this course.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Basics of Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, we will discuss about the basics of time series data, application of time series forecasting, and the standard process followed to build a forecasting model, time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Pre-processing Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn how to visualize time series, perform feature engineering, do re-sampling of data, and various other tools to analyze and prepare the data for models and execute time series forecasting, time series analysis and implement Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 5 -</strong> <strong>Getting Data Ready for Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment and missing value imputation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 6 - Forecasting using Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 7 - Theoretical Concepts</strong></p></li></ul><p>This part will give you a solid understanding of concepts involved in Neural Networks.</p><p>In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 8 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills related to time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques to immediately see practical benefits in your work place.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this course on time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques!</strong></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-03-12_13-39-50-cc4bf64c2dea96d9e7c5520dbc5a99dc/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637264749&Signature=jgEkGhlQLH2vdyGrGPLYF8BODdJE2sM0PYPOPVIpeBYjFWM34FR5zsC0agDBk7iiKa1rbk3jQwTzAee8Z8QB6jDajKLWeXWj48s8DohPdL0hC64QzQPWaQlvxbOGBmmESSk--2yywUyfEISbpboyS-U3uFNOgvUllidiOG2vXZhDTmwjcL5-qZDl0Oarr2Tis2CdQu8-3-ZWjcQfvKjrHDMy6u29C-TkOrsI-YPlBteVBBtWgF6tinUjPV3f3xuNAo3o5dRS6ySNaYJLTsHob~ywK0BGFq9b2Mxlkm~ObC1~S7xISHuxYrJYBZzxzBGj-0yhxJUFGL7cbBDQoXLx5g__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4384608", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Cryptocurrency & Blockchain", "title": "Curso Completo de Certificaci\u00f3n NFT (Principiante a Experto)", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Antonio Luis", "duration": "5,5 horas", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "1735", "coupon_code": "3CB1F638AFFCE61A1ED5", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4384608_6ee1_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-de-certificacion-nftprincipiante-avanzado/?couponCode=3CB1F638AFFCE61A1ED5", "end_day": "2021-11-22 21:51:51+00:00", "headline": "Aprende todo sobre NFT: las mejores Claves, Trucos, Herramientas y Estrategias para que empieces a operar en el mercado", "description": "<p>\u00bfEstas buscando una manera eficaz y comprensible de entender el mundo NFT (tokens no fungibles), con la ayuda de ejemplos reales para aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo esta oportunidad y todo su potencial?</p><p><br></p><p>Entonces este curso es para ti.</p><p>Esto es un curso <strong>PR\u00c1CTICO</strong> que tiene como \u00fanico objetivo ense\u00f1arte <strong>PASO a PASO</strong>, de manera detallada y con ejemplos reales, <strong>TODO</strong> lo que necesitas saber sobre el mundo del NFT, para que puedas empezar a utilizar todo el conocimiento que vas a recibir, incluso si no sabes nada sobre NFTs actualmente.</p><p>Cualquier persona puede comprar un NFT.

Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2019-06-18_12-59-58-03caeadbd0fd28015868d7836c8261f8/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=GUHAp7KZQOC2wLB0JHVzjQ%3D%3D%2C1637264851"}, {"course_id": "3423978", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Atlassian Confluence Masterclass for Project Managers", "level": "All Levels", "author": "GenMan Solutions", "duration": "5.5 hours", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "398", "students": "78841", "coupon_code": "CONFNOV2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3423978_990e.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/atlassian-confluence-masterclass/?couponCode=CONFNOV2", "end_day": "2021-11-22 06:24:13+00:00", "headline": "Confluence: Complete & Comprehensive course on the Cloud version of Atlassian's Confluence for Project Management", "description": "<p>Confluence is a <strong>powerful enterprise collaboration tool</strong> that brings people, knowledge, and ideas together in a shared workspace, so you can do your best work.

There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</p><p>Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a <em>pallavi</em>, an <em>anupallavi</em>, <em>muktaayi swaras</em>, a <em>charanam</em>, and <em>chittaswaras</em>. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).</p><p>Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.</p><p><strong>Types of varnams</strong></p><p>Named for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, <em>tana varnams</em> only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.</p><p>With rhythmic elements like a padam, <em>pada varnams</em> are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the <em>tana varnam</em> which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a <em>pada varnam</em> also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, <em>pada varnams</em> contain more lyrical content than a <em>tana varnam</em>.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.<em>Padajathi varnams</em> are simply <em>pada varnams</em> that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.</p><p><strong>Contents of a varnam</strong></p><p>The name \"varnam\" (meaning \"letter\") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.</p><p>Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.</p><p>The varnam is subdivided into several sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pallavi</strong>: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anupallavi</strong>: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muktaayi</strong>: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like <em>s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one</em>). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charanam</strong>: Sung with lyrics</p></li><li><p><strong>Chitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram</strong>: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anubandham</strong>: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.</p></li></ul><p>Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.</p><p>Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, <em>Adi Tala</em> (8 beat cycle) and <em>Ata Tala</em> (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the <em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice</p><p><strong>Famous varnams</strong></p><p><em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams include :</p><ul><li><p>\"Sami Ninne\" in <em>Shree ragam</em> composed by <em>Karur Devudu Iyer</em> in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Ninnukori\" in <em>Mohanam ragam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Evvari Bodhana\" in <em>Abhogi ragam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Era Naapai\" in <em>Todi raagam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Valachi Vacchi\" in <em>Navaraagamalika</em> in Telugu (9 ragas, similar to <em>Ragamalika</em> which literally translates to a <em>garland of ragams</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Ata Tala</em> Varnams include:</p><ul><li><p>\"Viriboni\" in <em>Bhairavi ragam</em> by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Nera Nammiti\" in <em>Kaanada raagam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Chalamela\" in <em>Sankarabharanam</em> by Swati Tirunal in Telugu</p></li></ul><p>The <em>Arabhi</em> ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.</p><p>The \"Mathe Malayadhwaja\" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancers</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-10-07_14-34-01-cb6fa294290f4137dc71c52dde409964/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637265047&Signature=Pn5RKoAHKUg8G46HhTAj7pl37Yy4w1qIaE0JkAPBkQWTjhqTskiAv4WkiZBTek-yM6zgfkzZrACqnysiBsWEVMhyXb71~ohf8qm~anejnRH6LO2DHWic95xh30WL-YlAKm8qOzPsjVKnZJNkNvW2RnbTCGULBxTufa2736fU84RgfrG4UAsM6C7TgVj1S6zXl6cSLUdJnx-dOBnBHO3vJWk01QJ7jHp2vu29C0vZ~U4NakK37Nexxd5JlZ7AzqZvY3bUBSQJuT7SZeB3LAuaQiIF8rxjpoE5Uhq8FniO4IDIbBopGCRIKRn05iuhWWZetZqNFfh36PHFOUyb3sJEpA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4228220", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Video & Mobile Marketing", "title": "Tubebuddy Masterclass - Guide to YouTube Keyword Tool", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "47", "students": "15519", "coupon_code": "176829749830957C3441", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4228220_d35a.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tubebuddy/?couponCode=176829749830957C3441", "end_day": "2021-11-22 09:29:20+00:00", "headline": "Learn Everything about Tubebuddy, its Features, Licenses, Keyword Research tool and YouTube SEO Optimisation", "description": "<p><em>Finally, a YouTube Channel Management Tool That Makes Creating &amp; Growing A YouTube Channel Fun &amp; Easy!</em></p><p>With a good YouTube channel management tool, you can have a complete overview of your channel's analytics.
