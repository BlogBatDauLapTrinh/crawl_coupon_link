You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text. This video is a total highlight in <strong>Digishock 3.0</strong>. </p><p><strong><em>Enrol now in the course.&nbsp;A&nbsp;mind-blowing educative experience is promised for all learners.</em></strong></p><p>Let's start learning about the upcoming new&nbsp;futuristic technologies that are based on Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>There is no time to wait. </p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!&nbsp;</p><p>The most awaited \"<strong><em>Digishock 3.0\" </em></strong><em>course</em> is finally here.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4443494", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Mobile Development", "title": "\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0645\u062a\u0641\u0642 \u0645\u0639 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0631 2.8.1 \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0639\u0644\u064a", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Michelle Raouf", "duration": "342", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "4", "students": "2150", "coupon_code": "FB0529377A446F367A7D", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4443494_38a2_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-dart-learning-guide-with-null-safety/?couponCode=FB0529377A446F367A7D", "end_day": "2022-04-06 08:21:00+00:00", "headline": "\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062a 2022", "description": "<p>\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0633 \u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 </p><p><br></p><p>\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0633\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a</p><p><br></p><p>\u0648 \u0647\u064a\u062a\u0645 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0645\u062c\u0629 \u0644\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u064a\u0629</p><p><br></p><p>1- DataTypes ( String , int , double , list ,set , map , date time )</p><p><br></p><p>2 -

Talking about the business, development, or marketing field, for instance, it is worth noting that Artificial Intelligence does not apply in a pure form to real self-aware intelligence machines in this sense. Instead, it can be considered a generic term for the number of software powered by automation that is being used by developers of websites and smartphone apps. They include the recognition of images and speech, cognitive computing, automated processing, and machine learning - for that matter. </p><p>Speaking of AI&nbsp;in app creation, for many years, starting with Apple's Siri, AI has already been influential in app-creation and marketing growth. It has the ability to advance even further in the coming years. Retail giants such as eBay and Amazon have already shown the ability for AI mobile applications to thrive. With new developments in technology and evolving customer expectations, the production of AI-powered mobile apps is the new digital frontier for businesses.</p><p>Further speaking, the extension of AI technology has allowed mobile users to reposition the current user experience value benchmark - altogether.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for <strong>computer forensics</strong> but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.</p><p>Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved</p><p>During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.</p><p>Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4458928", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Kennzahlen im Online-Marketing & E-Commerce", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Kristoffer Ditz", "duration": "114", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "4", "students": "170", "coupon_code": "5CCAE8089F5F8C417719", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4458928_f3e4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/kennzahlen-im-online-marketing-e-commerce/?couponCode=5CCAE8089F5F8C417719", "end_day": "2022-04-02 10:09:00+00:00", "headline": "Lernen Sie, welche Kennzahlen es im Online Marketing und E-Commerce gibt", "description": "<p><strong>Allgemein</strong></p><p>Im <strong>Online-Marketing</strong> und <strong>E-Commerce</strong> sind sehr viele <strong>Kennzahlen</strong> im Einsatz, die das Ergebnis vom Unternehmen stark beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen.</p><p>Los geht es mit den Besucher-Zahlen, aber wussten Sie, dass die Besucher in mehrere Kategorien/Arten unterteilt werden?</p><p>Auch ein Kaufabschluss setzt sich aus mehreren <strong>Kennzahlen </strong>zusammen.

Smart robots or robot advisors will provide instant research or findings in the fields of finance, insurance, law, the media, and journalism, and medical diagnosis and support will be provided by AI software on the health front. Other advantages include increasing productivity dramatically in research and development programs by reducing time to the market, enhancing the transport and supply chain networks and improving governance by improved decision-making processes etc.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technology is aiding the following prominent fields for 2022 and many others:</p><p>Website Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to create websites and landing pages in merely minutes.</p><p>App Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence tools can help to automate the whole concept of creating apps.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) \u2212 This process is simulating the actual interaction with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.</p><p>Expert Systems \u2212 Learners and users will be provided with guided information and advice on the computer or software.</p><p>Vision Systems \u2212&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;systems in 2022 can understand, explain and describe the computer's visual input to the ultimate core.</p><p>Spoken Word or Speech Recognition \u2212 Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based speech recognition systems are capable of listening, voicing and recognizing the user input - i.e. when a person speaks with them. Alexa, Siri and Google's assistant, are examples of this function. </p><p>Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help users to create and experiment with machine learning models and build data science applications in a flash. </p><p>Video Creation - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate video production and cut high costs of hiring resources and team as everything is taken care of in the cloud. </p><p>Python and Coding tools - Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can help to automate writing lakhs of lines of code in python and even Java or PHP&nbsp;in minutes without the need for a human coder or even someone who will debug the code. Everything is automated in the concept of AI-powered programming.</p><p>This mind-blowing exhaustive course focusing on&nbsp; <strong>\"Artificial Intelligence Expert Course:&nbsp;Platinum&nbsp;Edition\" </strong>taught by Digital Marketing Legend Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan<strong> </strong>and Civil&nbsp;MasterMind Saranya Srinidhi will change your perspective on the concept of Artificial Intelligence forever to rely on AI tools of the future for your needs.

You will also see the growth of the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;tools across industries that have exploded and its impact on business and society that is emerging at a quick pace. In this incredible journey, you will also encounter businesses that are pushing the limits of automation, search and social media. As you slowly realize that with the brain of a computer, AI would potentially automate control in such sectors as self-employed vehicles and non-manned drones, you will be left spellbound.</p><p><strong>\"Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;will not only reduce costs by automating processes but also skyrocket revenues by helping startups and corporates introduce new product and service categories at the fastest speed ever imagined with limited resources.\"</strong></p><p><strong><em>But, will jobs die as automation takes over?&nbsp;Will AI will surpass human intelligence in 2022, itself? The answer to these questions is a \"No\".</em></strong></p><p>The development and eventual growth in AI apps helping in productivity will provide workers with a range of opportunities to improve their skills and concentrate on creative aspects. Stating additional forecasts, disruptive market trends are highly likely to occur in the AI Expansion period (i.e. 2025-2030), the opportunity for employment would require a high degree of personalization, innovation or ability tasks which will still require a person to perform them (even though the AI robotic tools have actually speeded up the process). These occupations or technologies are difficult to imagine at this stage, yet these occupations will rapidly increase as new specialization are required when the demand would kick in. The time is coming soon for a global Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;revolution to strongly emerge. </p><p>Okay. Let's start learning and go on an adventure in Artificial Intelligence. Enrol Now and I will see you inside. Let's rock this world with learning secretive tools.

Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.</p></li><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basics, try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>What is BigQuery used for?</strong></p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong> is a web service from Google that is <strong>used for</strong> handling or analyzing big data. Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform. As a NoOps (no operations) data analytics service, <strong>Google BigQuery</strong> offers users the ability to manage data using fast SQL-like queries for real-time analysis.</p><p><strong>Is BigQuery free?</strong></p><p>For users of Google BigQuery the first 10GB of storage per month is free and the first 1TB of query per month is free. Post these limits, Google BigQuery is chargeable.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p>Google BigQuery is used by companies such as Spotify, The New York Times, Stack Etc.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "3430002", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Affiliate Marketing", "title": "eCommerce Marketing Course (2022 Grand Edition)", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "143", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "159", "students": "47143", "coupon_code": "5225CD74B23A86CEC902", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3430002_edd2_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/ecommerce-marketing-certification/?couponCode=5225CD74B23A86CEC902", "end_day": "2022-04-03 08:17:00+00:00", "headline": "An incredible online course focussed on eCommerce Marketing", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience&nbsp;</em><strong><em>\"</em>eCommerce Marketing Course (2022 Grand Edition)\"</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>eCommerce Marketing</em></strong> is the definitive practice of driving a ton of traffic to a website or portal to bring forth sales and customers.

Fue primeramente introducida por la NASA en 1960 como una posible medida para detectar vida en otros planetas y como medida preventiva de contaminaci\u00f3n en el agua reciclada durante largos viajes al espacio. La Bioluminiscencia es un fen\u00f3meno natural que ocurre en muchas algas y bacterias acu\u00e1ticas, as\u00ed como en la luz producida por las luci\u00e9rnagas que se tom\u00f3 como base para evolucionar esta tecnolog\u00eda. El Adenosin Trifosfato (ATP) es un compuesto presente en todos los seres vivos, animales y plantas, incluyendo gran n\u00famero de alimentos y residuos de alimentos, bacterias, hongos y otros microorganismos. La cantidad de ATP puede ser usada como indicador de higiene proporcionando as\u00ed una medida de su estado de limpieza y de la eficiencia de los procesos de limpieza, detergentes y desinfectantes.</p><p>Pero aunque la t\u00e9cnica de Bioluminiscencia permite verificar el estado higi\u00e9nico sanitario en forma instant\u00e1nea, no excluye que se deben realizar siembras microbiol\u00f3gicas de acuerdo a los planes de seguimiento establecidos</p><p>Las luci\u00e9rnagas nos permiten comprender el fen\u00f3meno de bioluminiscencia, es decir, la emisi\u00f3n de luz fr\u00eda por organismos vivos. Es una reacci\u00f3n qu\u00edmica que usan las luci\u00e9rnagas masculinas para atraer a las femeninas y \u00e9stas responden tambi\u00e9n emitiendo luz. La reacci\u00f3n se da cuando la luciferina, mol\u00e9cula responsable de la emisi\u00f3n de luz, es transformada en oxiluciferina por una enzima llamada luciferasa. La luciferasa consume ox\u00edgeno y una mol\u00e9cula de ATP, principal fuente de energ\u00eda de los seres vivos, para liberar luz a 560 nan\u00f3metros (nm). Posteriormente la oxiluciferina v\u00eda otras reacciones, es reciclada para formar nuevamente luciferina. De este modo es posible convertir la energ\u00eda qu\u00edmica en energ\u00eda lum\u00ednica</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Spanish"}]}
