Make sure you\u2019re sitting comfortably, as it\u2019s time to see how to put all the information you\u2019ve learned on copywriting into practice\u2026From your sales pages to your press releases, video scripts, blog post headlines meta descriptions, and email campaigns to your Facebook posts and Press releases, knowing how to create great copy will help your marketing efforts enormously. When you learn how to do it right, you'll be able to get higher conversion rates on key pages, improve the structure of your blogs, get more engagement in social media, and have many more people share your content.</p><p>Most importantly of all, you'll be able to understand your customer\u2019s needs, which will help you connect with your target audience much better. To create truly great copy, you first need to know your audience. You must understand what drives them, their hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears and desires.</p><p>Once you have this knowledge, you'll be able to write copy that immediately connects with the people you're trying to reach, because you'll be speaking their language. This will make all your content 100% more effective, and you'll find it easier to be able to get people to take the action you want. Knowing how to write good copy is an essential marketing skill, that will help you boost your reach, sell more, and get more customer engagement. </p><p>It will also make you much more employable, according to the national association of colleges and employers, 73% of employers want to hire people with strong writing skills.</p><p><strong>Get Max Attention From the Off</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click-throughs, you must use headers that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of headers are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make headers sound more specific: like 10 Top tips to get ripped fast, or 5 PRO ways to protect your privacy online. Don\u2019t just cast out clickbait headers that bear no relation to your content, or people will lose trust in you and switch off.</p><p><strong>Don\u2019t Evade Your Emotions</strong></p><p>While it\u2019s true that dropping stats and facts helps you build trust and credibility, if you do this too much, you\u2019ll end up boring people. Your copy needs a human element to be relatable, and one of the most powerful ways to achieve this is making your content emotional. Use high-impact words, and share funny stories, or situations your audience can relate to, so that they can put themselves right in the scenario. When you add an element of personality, you\u2019ll make your followers feel closer to you than to other content creators who play it safe and stick to the facts.</p><p><strong>Identify Your Audience\u2019s Pain Points</strong></p><p>Pain points are problems people stress about and look for a solution too. Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action. Let your your audience know they must act now<em> </em>if they want the solution.</p><p><strong>Learn Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p>Because of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a huge competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>When You Enrol, You Also Get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course Materials And Tuition Worth At Least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost</p></li><li><p>23 PRO Content Marketing Templates ready for download</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and Free Extra Resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes &amp; Assignments</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today</p></li><li><p>PDF Digital Nomad Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Starter pack for digital nomads</p></li><li><p>PDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically</p></li><li><p>PDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients</p></li><li><p>PDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination</p></li><li><p>PDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling</p></li><li><p>PDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value</p></li></ul><p><strong>Copywriting Has Become One of the Most-In-Demand Skills of 2022. </strong></p><p>In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year.

I learned a lot about filmmaking from the Internet, but there was one thing that I couldn't find online, and that is how to actually make my own film. A real film, a feature film. A film that I can share with the whole world. A film that I can watch on TV. I needed to find a way to make a film without relying on people donating their money for my film or without hurting friends and family by asking them to help me make my film.</p><p>So that's what I did. I rolled my sleeves and jumped into self-education. As years went on I made mistakes, I improved, and I learned from my own failures. And this is what this course is all about.

When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Desktop data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "False", "category": "None", "sub_category": "None", "title": "None", "level": "None", "author": "None", "duration": "None", "rating": "None", "reviews": "None", "students": "None", "coupon_code": "None", "preview_img": "None", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-the-complete-introduction-to-sql-programming?couponCode=A2C1E4BFC498547EB2B8", "end_day": "None", "headline": "None", "description": "None", "preview_video": "None", "locale": "None"}, {"course_id": "4321230", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Video & Mobile Marketing", "title": "YouTube Thumbnail Masterclass / Ultimate Guide to Thumbnails", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "58", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "177", "students": "27736", "coupon_code": "75DA6017C027D4E3DEF8", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4321230_70a0.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/youtube-thumbnails-masterclass/?couponCode=DA32B2C611952C9FD5F3", "end_day": "2022-04-20 02:44:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to make a YouTube thumbnail and master the art of creating great thumbnails for your videos.", "description": "<p>It's not a secret to anyone anymore.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable.

AWS Shield Standard\u2019s always-on detection and mitigation systems automatically scrubs bad traffic at Layer 3 and 4 to protect your application.

Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Deep Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "False", "category": "None", "sub_category": "None", "title": "None", "level": "None", "author": "None", "duration": "None", "rating": "None", "reviews": "None", "students": "None", "coupon_code": "None", "preview_img": "None", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-crash-course-2021?couponCode=MYSQLCOURSE41", "end_day": "None", "headline": "None", "description": "None", "preview_video": "None", "locale": "None"}, {"course_id": "4065232", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Operating Systems & Servers", "title": "\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0639 \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0643\u0633", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ahmed Elesawy", "duration": "242", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "121", "students": "12148", "coupon_code": "75DA6017C027D4E3DEF8", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4065232_13dc_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-course/?couponCode=74DEA0A409E9D4152AEE", "end_day": "2022-04-19 12:30:00+00:00", "headline": "\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0643\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0647", "description": "<p>\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0648 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0647 ,</p><p>\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0643\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648 \u0647\u064a \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0628 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0639 \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0643\u0633 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0647\u064a \u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0643\u0633 \u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0643\u0633 \u0648 \u062a\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0639\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u0643\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0628\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u062f\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0648 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641\u0627\u062a \u062b\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0642 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0648 \u0646\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u0644\u0646\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062e\u0628\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0648 \u0647\u064a \u0645\u0644\u0641\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0648\u0638\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u0641 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0648\u064a </p><p>\u0627\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 :</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>-&nbsp;

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. </p><p>Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. </p><p>In this introduction to computer programming course, you\u2019ll learn and practice key computer science concepts. You\u2019ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you\u2019ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own programs.</p><p>This Computer science and programming using python course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.</p><p>Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece. And those steps can be executed by a computer.</p><p>In this course, we will not get into everything that you need to be a programmer, but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be <strong>fluently</strong> programming in Python and you'll be so good at Python that you can get a job or use the language professionally.</p><p>You'll cover all that you need to be an accomplished Python Programmer.

Its Weight in Gold.<br></p><p>Being creative is a very desirable trait in modern society. Before the modern information age creativity was not something the average person really needed in order to be a productive member of society. In the 19th and most of the 20th century all or most people needed was the ability to follow instructions well. Being creative was reserved for a small educated elite and artists of various types. Today things are very different. Thanks to automation those un-creative and monotonous jobs are being taken over by machines. We\u2019re in the knowledge economy now and even low-level jobs need a component of creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>But, at the same time...&nbsp;In today\u2019s world, it is absolutely impossible to become successful without inculcating creativity in your profession, whether it is setting up a small business. opening an HR or design agency, creating a new entertainment park for children or adults, or for that matter opening an online shop\u2026 All these require a lot of creativity, no less than painting a mural, creating a new sculpture, or working on a series of photos.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I know you might be thinking, I am not a creative person. How will I become creative?? Well! that is what YOU are going to learn in this course. I and my fellow instructor Libby, have spent a great deal of time building this course.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This course is an INTERACTIVE&nbsp;course, having said that... YOU will do many exercises throughout the course lectures and each exercise is designed to open up your CREATIVE&nbsp;MIND</p><p><br></p><p>This course is NOT an easy fix, it is an ongoing process of learning and creating... And if you are not willing to invest time in yourself to create an AMAZING&nbsp;YOU... then this course is not for you.</p><p>So, be prepared to Unleash YOUR Creative Mind!!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "False", "category": "None", "sub_category": "None", "title": "None", "level": "None", "author": "None", "duration": "None", "rating": "None", "reviews": "None", "students": "None", "coupon_code": "None", "preview_img": "None", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-tutorial-for-the-absolute-beginner-code-included?couponCode=RM2022-2", "end_day": "None", "headline": "None", "description": "None", "preview_video": "None", "locale": "None"}, {"course_id": "2769402", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Microsoft", "title": "Microsoft Power Automate (Flow) Ultimate Course 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "362", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "268", "students": "68091", "coupon_code": "75DA6017C027D4E3DEF8", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2769402_08ef_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-microsoft-power-automate/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42203", "end_day": "2022-04-20 13:06:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Microsoft Power Automate (Flow)", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn Microsoft Power Automate but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to create Flows and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then Microsoft Power Automate 2022 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Microsoft Power Automate is an in-demand skill in 2022. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start creating Flows like an expert with Microsoft Power Automate.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of Microsoft Power Automate. </p><p>This is great for students starting or for IT Personal that need a refresher course on Microsoft Power Automate.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 6 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p><strong>Here is what you will Learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "3659224", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Google", "title": "Google Docs Ultimate Course 2021", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "208", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "532", "students": "65915", "coupon_code": "75DA6017C027D4E3DEF8", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3659224_9e22_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/google-docs-master-course/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42203", "end_day": "2022-04-20 12:57:00+00:00", "headline": "Go from Beginner to Advanced with Google Docs", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn Google Docs but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to make amazing Docs and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then Google Docs 2021 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Google Docs is an in-demand skill in 2021. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start building Docs like an expert with Google Docs.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of Google Docs. </p><p>This is great for students starting or for Designers that need a refresher course on Google Docs.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 3 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p><strong>Here is what you will Learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.

We plan on updating this course so that you can continue to use it as a reference even as QuickBooks Online evolves its software. We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online. We will go over each option in more detail in the course.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial, perfect to practice with</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They also often offer a student version, which may provide more extended access to the software, and this would be great considering we will be covering a comprehensive problem.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>QuickBooks also provides a free test drive file.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the course will discuss how to access QuickBooks Online, the accounting software options QuickBooks offers, and set up our QuickBooks file.</p><p>We will then practice navigating the accounting software, the free QuickBooks Online Test Drive File being our primary tool. When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "2444066", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Setup a Virtual Web Server using Linode or Digital Ocean", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "duration": "138", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "336", "students": "112009", "coupon_code": "75DA6017C027D4E3DEF8", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2444066_fc28_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/setup-a-virtual-web-server-using-linode-or-digital-ocean/?couponCode=YOUACCEL60189", "end_day": "2022-04-19 02:15:00+00:00", "headline": "Deploy, Configure, and Scale a Production Virtual Web Server on Linode or Digital Ocean.
