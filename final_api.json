This course will give you everything you need to understand what SFBT is and how to use it.</p><p>What makes it different from other forms of counselling? It is solution-focused rather than problem-focused in that most of the time is spent talking about a client\u2019s strengths, accomplishments (known as exceptions) and solutions to problems. This is in contrast to traditional psychotherapy that is problem-focused: all of the time is spent talking about problems. SFBT focuses on what the client <em>can</em> do rather than what they can\u2019t.</p><p>Secondly, it\u2019s brief. SFBT rejects the idea that psychotherapy needs to be many weeks of regular appointments. Instead, it proposes that we get to work helping clients straight away, working with the client\u2019s agenda, and spacing sessions out more widely.</p><p>Solution-Focused Brief Therapy can be applied to a wide range of problems including depression, anxiety, mental health, substance abuse, relationships and couples, and much more. We\u2019ll look at what its founders, Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg, said as well as more up-to-date research on the topic.</p><p>In the course, we will cover:</p><ul><li><p>What Solution-Focused Brief Therapy is and how it works</p></li><li><p>Step-by-step how to do SFBT</p></li><li><p>Solution-focused specific techniques</p></li><li><p>Using the miracle question and scale questions</p></li><li><p>Building a strong therapeutic relationship with clients</p></li><li><p>Professional issues working in SFBT</p></li></ul><p>We will use examples and exercises throughout the course to help you embed the knowledge. We\u2019ll also look at a series of case studies to show you what SFBT looks like when applied to depression, problems at school and couples counselling. You\u2019ll also receive a comprehensive handbook with the course.</p><p>On completing the course, you will earn a certificate accredited by the International Association of Therapists.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-12-16_18-14-27-ea2479e6b29c20926f52ed6c4737d9e6/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1639810884&Signature=YHtvyh4jtwgiYMfTgcT~JsCPKo4XEIV0gpMz52ji3uXZnuIyiQSSberCzMjQ-ew8-0fGq9dFfeG4MvK8JStdYYknmyjPzlRKXLaBthCGry5taJxRiFMwSeM5gHM5OtYBaP8ypxcfvLKgE6m82Qy907YVWEOwg4TcpP7TgKAuTyLILJRuCAatCWd-uM4w9VsuaDYYSHEXgfcl6Xf4mY7AaLYhtvATjBrC6TGuxGXZXkA2BXdBVYwmW8SQd0WMNQlOx0gWFU-tUJlgZyrrVjOVHUdsnFCqUaEuFZLuGyhil2D2Fu9CQD1uT5nu7VMUMcd8nKZv9PZOUYQOqr~QOBBu~A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4225332", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Utreon Masterclass - Ultimate Guide to YouTube Alternative", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "43", "students": "18798", "coupon_code": "B4BD85FD0F67690DFF83", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4225332_8269.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/utreon-course/?couponCode=B4BD85FD0F67690DFF83", "end_day": "2021-12-20 04:01:25+00:00", "headline": "Learn about Content Creation on Utreon - The newest YouTube Alternative", "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Utreon Masterclass - Ultimate Guide to YouTube Alternative!</strong></p><p>The only course you will need to start with Utreon, one of the best and newest video hosting platforms and YouTube alternatives for aspiring content creators.</p><p>Utreon is a relatively new video hosting platform that allows you to host your channel and content and gain access to large and untapped audiences that is simply impossible to reach nowadays on YouTube.

Old are eligible to take the exam</p></li><li><p>Must be able to speak and write any of Canada\u2019s official languages (English and French)</p></li><li><p>Have been settling in Canada for 3 years out of the last 5 years before the day of application.</p></li><li><p>Have filed all taxes for at least 3 years during the last 5 years, note that all income taxes that you owe must be fully paid.</p></li></ul><p>Canadian Citizenship can only be obtained through a legal permanent residency in Canada or through the following.</p><p><strong>If the person is under 18 years of age,</strong> the guardian or the parent of the applicant will have to apply on behalf of them for a citizenship.</p><p><strong>If the person is over 18 years of age and have children,</strong> he/she can include application with your own.</p><p>Fast track citizenship application process is given to any member of the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces.</strong></p><p>Upon the day of the test, the applicant must present a letter of consent from the government informing the authorities on the actual day of your test, followed by an informal interview that can take up to 30 minutes and you will be asked to provide all the necessary documents for the citizenship test.</p><p>Each applicant must bring the following,</p><ul><li><p>Record of Landing (IMM 1000) or <em>Confirmation of Permanent Residence</em> (IMM 5292)</p></li><li><p>Permanent Resident Card (PRC).</p></li><li><p>One identity document which includes the applicant\u2019s photograph with signature.</p></li><li><p>Passports and all travel documents that the applicant possess.</p></li><li><p>Original copies of all supporting documents such as <em>Birth Certificate, Marriage Contract etc.</em></p></li></ul><p>After submitting the requirements, it will now be verified through the following information,</p><ul><li><p>Signature of the applicant on the notice form is necessary.</p></li><li><p>The signature provided in the notice form will be verified by comparing it to the signatures in the applicant\u2019s supporting documents.</p></li><li><p>Photos provided along with the supporting documents will be verified against the person in front of the official.

These are software design principles, writing highly organized code, code planning, code refactoring, SQL databases, and more.</p><p>We designed this course for both absolute and non-absolute beginners. However, if you are an intermediate who knows Python well, you may still benefit from the course because it covers some advanced Python and programming concepts that you will hardly find anywhere else. Advanced concepts, such as abstract classes, class methods, composition, refactoring, etc., will be comprehensively covered and practiced in the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do I need previous experience with other programming languages to take this course?</strong></p><p>No. In fact, in this course, you will not merely learn Python syntax.

Make sure you\u2019re sitting comfortably, as it\u2019s time to see how to put all the information you\u2019ve learned on copywriting into practice\u2026 From your sales pages to your press releases, video scripts, blog post headlines meta descriptions, and email campaigns to your Facebook posts and Press releases, knowing how to create great copy will help your marketing efforts enormously. When you learn how to do it right, you'll be able to get higher conversion rates on key pages, improve the structure of your blogs, get more engagement in social media, and have many more people share your content.</p><p>Most importantly of all, you'll be able to understand your customer\u2019s needs, which will help you connect with your target audience much better. To create truly great copy, you first need to know your audience. You must understand what drives them, their hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears and desires.</p><p>Once you have this knowledge, you'll be able to write copy that immediately connects with the people you're trying to reach, because you'll be speaking their language. This will make all your content 100% more effective, and you'll find it easier to be able to get people to take the action you want. Knowing how to write good copy is an essential marketing skill, that will help you boost your reach, sell more, and get more customer engagement. </p><p><strong>IT WILL ALSO MAKE YOU MUCH MORE EMPLOYABLE, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS, 73% OF EMPLOYERS WANT TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH STRONG WRITING SKILLS.</strong></p><p><strong>GET MAX ATTENTION FROM THE OFF</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use headers that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of headers are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make headers sound more specific: like 10 Top tips to get ripped fast, or 5 PRO ways to protect your privacy online. Don\u2019t just cast out clickbait headers that bear no relation to your content, or people will lose trust in you and switch off.</p><p><strong>DON\u2019T SHY AWAY FROM EMOTION</strong></p><p>While it\u2019s true that dropping stats and facts helps you build trust and credibility, if you do this too much, you\u2019ll end up boring people. Your copy needs a human element to be relatable, and one of the most powerful ways to achieve this is making your content emotional. Use high impact words, and share funny stories, or situations your audience can relate to, so that they can put themselves right in the scenario. When you add an element of personality, you\u2019ll make your followers feel closer to you than to other content creators who play it safe and stick to the facts.</p><p><strong>IDENTIFY YOUR AUDIENCE\u2019S PAIN POINTS</strong></p><p>Pain points are problems people stress about and look for a solution too. Your job as a marketer is to emphasise these pain points but in a way that hints YOU can provide the solution. To find out your potential customer\u2019s pain points, you must do market research on your target demographic, to identify their fears, desires, and needs. Market research doesn\u2019t have to be conventional, if your typical customer hangs on out Reddit, why not monitor what they post about and use this to make your copy hold more appeal? When you stress customer\u2019s pain points, you should also highlight the importance of immediate action. Let your your audience know they must act now<em> </em>if they want the solution.</p><p><strong>LEARN SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for. SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p>Because of the amount of online content we consume, demand for skilled SEO experts and pro copywriters has grown massively. More brands than ever require well-written content, that\u2019s optimised to perform well in search. If you can combine the two, you\u2019ll have a huge competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>WHEN YOU ENROL, YOU ALSO GET:</strong></p><ul><li><p>COURSE MATERIALS AND TUITION Worth AT LEAST $1080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!!</p></li><li><p>23 PRO CONTENT MARKETING TEMPLATES ready for download</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and FREE EXTRA RESOURCES you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes &amp; Assignments</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question ANYTIME</p></li></ul><p><strong>COPYWRITING HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IN-DEMAND SKILLS OF 2022.

However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3438236", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Other Business", "title": "Make Money From Home As a Transcriptionist: 10 Opportunities", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Roope Kiuttu", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "488", "students": "69959", "coupon_code": "DF8ACC981A08079F3143", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3438236_bf8d_6.jpg?secure=nmXYyADUiAum8bNI3N1rsQ%3D%3D%2C1639881228", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/work-home-transcription-jobs/?couponCode=DF8ACC981A08079F3143", "end_day": "2021-12-18 08:05:20+00:00", "headline": "Learn the Details about Making Money Online with 10 Transcription Jobs From Home", "description": "<p><strong>Do you want to make money from home typing what you hear?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you like to make money online with flexible hours wherever you want?</strong></p><p>Then this is the PERFECT&nbsp;UDEMY&nbsp;Course for you!</p><p>You're gonna find out the details about Making Money Online with 10 Transcription Jobs From Home and spot the best opportunities for you.</p><p>Over the years, I've seen dozens of transcription jobs from home and you need to know the differences:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Some of them are easy and suitable for beginners.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Others require more experience but they'll pay you more.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Some opportunities only operate in specific countries.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Other money-making opportunities are available worldwide.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Dive into the lessons and see the differences between these 10 Transcription Jobs From Home.</p><p>Then you can choose the best Money-Making option for you.</p><p>I'll see you inside!</p><p>- Roope \"Sharing the blessing of making money from home\"&nbsp;Kiuttu</p><p><strong>PS. </strong>Making money online has several benefits:</p><ol><li><p>Work anywhere you want.</p></li><li><p>Work anytime you want.</p></li><li><p>Work as much or as little as you want.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The opportunities are right in front of your nose.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3850302", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Sales", "title": "First Steps Into Selling Smarter", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nevcihan Dogan", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "175", "students": "46039", "coupon_code": "DEC.2021", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3850302_4d8e.jpg?secure=eRnl5-_WjhJz7D4C0qX-9Q%3D%3D%2C1639881244", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/first-steps-into-selling-smarter-t/?couponCode=DEC.2021", "end_day": "2021-12-22 13:27:16+00:00", "headline": "Sales is a component of a company\u2019s marketing and promotions", "description": "<p>Broadly defined, today\u2019s top salespeople are in the business of identifying needs and persuading potential customers to respond favorably to an idea that will result in mutual satisfaction for both the buyer and the seller.</p><p><br>So with this course, you will become a skilled salesperson, skilled at networking and learn the 80/20 rule.

It takes courage, endeavor and commitment<br>to live in a new country and participate fully as a citizen. We value your contribution to our peaceful and<br>democratic society. Australian citizenship is an important step in your migration story.</p><p>The <strong>Australian citizenship test</strong> plays a valuable role in encouraging people to find out more about Australia, as well as understanding the responsibilities and privileges being an Australian citizen brings. All the information you need to pass the test is in the citizenship test resource Australian Citizenship: Our Common Bond.</p><p><br></p><p>About Australia Citizenship Practice Test:</p><p>\u2013 The test is in English<br>\u2013 consists of 20 multiple choice questions, and<br>\u2013 You must answer %75 of the questions correct in order to pass.<br>\u2013 There is not a separate English language test but you will need a basic knowledge of English to pass the test.</p><p>Before you can set the citizenship test, you must apply for citizenship. Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4321232", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "How to Print on Demand - Beginners Guide to POD", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "2 hours", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "38", "students": "11339", "coupon_code": "725190DB06C892603BB0", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4321232_ef1e.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-print-on-demand/?couponCode=725190DB06C892603BB0", "end_day": "2021-12-22 04:05:16+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to create a Print on Demand store even if you have no prior experience with E-Commerce!", "description": "<p>Beginners Guide to POD - Print On Demand Masterclass is a complete guide for beginners who want to start their own print-on-demand store.

It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.</p><p>Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It does this by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The term <em>Six Sigma</em> originates from statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a <em>sigma</em> rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates\u2014specifically, to within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.</p><p>Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p><p>In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\".</p><p>In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4430166", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "TOP Interview Questions of Data Structures and Algorithms(1)", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "", "rating": "2.0", "reviews": "2", "students": "1495", "coupon_code": "697CF271677BC9C70ED3", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4430166_30c8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/top-interview-questions-tests-of-data-structures-and-algorithms1/?couponCode=697CF271677BC9C70ED3", "end_day": "2021-12-22 16:49:22+00:00", "headline": "PART ONE : Data Structures and Algorithms (1) Test SIMULATOR Top tests and questions with Detailed Answers", "description": "<p><strong>TOP Interview Questions of Data Structures and Algorithms(1)</strong></p><p><strong>PART ONE : Data Structures and Algorithms (1) Test SIMULATOR Top tests and questions with Detailed Answers</strong></p><p>In computer science, a <strong>data structure</strong> is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.</p><p>Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.</p><p>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.</p><p>Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4415694", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Science", "title": "Molecular Dynamic Simulation on Gromacs Software", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "GHAFRAN ALI", "duration": "39 mins", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "4", "students": "1932", "coupon_code": "59A3A4500B34A151ADC7", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4415694_6a75_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/molecular-dynamic-simulation-on-gromacs-software/?couponCode=59A3A4500B34A151ADC7", "end_day": "2021-12-21 16:16:32+00:00", "headline": "Molecular Dynamics Simulations ,Gromacs Software ,MD Simulation ,Molecular Dynamic Simulation on Gromacs Software", "description": "<p>Students perform Molecular Dynamics Simulation without understanding why they are setting such parameter and why does those parameters even exist in the first place.
