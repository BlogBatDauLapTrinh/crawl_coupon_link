With the new skills you\u2019ll learn from us, you\u2019ll master the essentials of Digital Marketing, which will open up a whole new world of online success and career opportunities.</p><p><strong>What is digital marketing?</strong></p><p>Digital marketing is vital if you have a business or want to sell anything online. Even if you\u2019re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.</p><p>Just like traditional marketing, digital marketing, is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time. Digital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it\u2019s easier to course correct than it would be if you had invested in a print ad.</p><p><strong>What is social media?</strong></p><p>Social Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most of there is content produced being from the users not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn. </p><p>Due to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now essential for anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.</p><p><strong>What is SEO?</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimisation, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.</p><p>SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person\u2019s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match. Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website\u2019s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google\u2019s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It\u2019s important you don\u2019t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as \u201cTechnical SEO\u201d is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p><strong>When you enrol, you can use and customise our 23 content marketing templates</strong></p><p>This how to Content Marketing, Social Media &amp; SEO guide contains every essential type of example you\u2019ll ever need to empower your business:</p><ol><li><p>Facebook Ad Template 1</p></li><li><p>Facebook Ad Template 2</p></li><li><p>Landing Page Template</p></li><li><p>Mini Story Email</p></li><li><p>Email Teaser</p></li><li><p>Email Welcome Template</p></li><li><p>Sales Letter Template</p></li><li><p>The Detailed Listicle (Blogging)</p></li><li><p>The Product Comparison (Blogging)</p></li><li><p>The How-to Comprehensive Guide (Blogging)</p></li><li><p>Guest Blog Outreach Template</p></li><li><p>LinkedIn Ad Template</p></li><li><p>Outreach template for LinkedIn</p></li><li><p>Twitter Ad Template</p></li><li><p>Twitter Post Template</p></li><li><p>YouTube Video Description Template</p></li><li><p>Instagram Post Template</p></li><li><p>Instagram Ad Template</p></li><li><p>Press Release Template</p></li><li><p>Influencer Outreach Template</p></li><li><p>Backlink Outreach Template 1</p></li><li><p>Backlink Outreach Template 2</p></li><li><p>Template to ask for Social Shares from Influencers</p></li></ol><p>You\u2019ll see what you need to do - and why - and can tweak our practical samples so they suit your own needs exactly.

Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201cIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201d</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201cNo\u201d to the former and \u201cYes\u201d to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you and uncover all these techniques in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of<strong> </strong>these activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. </p><p><br></p><p>But how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I've spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden on. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a <strong>7-step model \u201cN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System</strong>\u201d. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me. Within months, hundreds of people saved 1000s of dollars and made numerous connections with some very influential people. I believe it to be the most powerful idea for a business, career, and personal life. </p><p><br></p><p>But what makes it so special? Only my words? Or something else? Well, here is the answer. Drawing on the latest research and best practices across a breadth of industries, the course goes far beyond simplistic formulas such as \"win-win\" and \"win-lose.\" Instead, it provides hard-hitting, practical, intensive, and transformative techniques. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged and amused, and teach you life-changing skills for home and work. The course discusses lots of real-life examples (some of which will definitely get you laughing) and gives practical tools you can use right away to get better results. And what more and better than the fact that you can learn all this by just sitting at your home. You don\u2019t need to get mauled by scrupulous people before you can learn the art of negotiations. Although to master it, you need to walk out and experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>After attending this program, you won\u2019t remain the same; the impact will be severe. AND massive! Your life will change forever. This is the surefire mantra to big-ticket successes. You will learn the art of crafting such compelling messages that people will surely open their hearts and wallets for you.</p><p><br></p><p>All this can be a reality for you as well. Think big.

I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish. </em>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits. <em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a Winning Facebook Ad Campaign, so you can see what you need to do and why. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select The Right Ad To Achieve Your Marketing Goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, engaging ads. Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel For Ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set Up Your First Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover The Customer Journey To Purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find Your Ideal Customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to hone in on your perfect customer. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting The Most Out Of The Facebook Pixel And Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and fast.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events To Take Your Ad Game To The Next Level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to get more from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Convert More, Sell Faster</strong></p><p>You'll receive my exclusive techniques for maximising your ad conversion rate on facebook.

Some different innovations which can be widely used nowadays encompass, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana make it convenient for human beings to carry out searches through simply urgent a button or pronouncing a voice command.</p><p>AI-based CRM (customer relationship management) tools make it convenient to maximise the gathering of consumer details and facts from special technologies utilised and this process can be fully automated too. It additionally helps to gain unique insights for target audiences and identify customers\u2019 needs so that groups can establish the most suitable advertising strategy.</p><p>This behavioural data makes it easy for the brands to apprehend clients\u2019 temper. For instance, the kinds of products someone buys, pages they browse, which gear they regularly use, etc. With all of these accrued facts, marketers can without problems examine a capacity client's needs, and adapt AI used to grow income.</p><p><strong>A note on&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Digital Marketing (2022 Gold Edition)&nbsp;- The Course</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;game-changing&nbsp;course taught in 2022 will cover<strong>&nbsp;artificial intelligence tools in content creation, curation, augmented reality,</strong> and digital marketing and will take you on a glimpse into the future. We will also look at influencer marketing tools, content trends and a bit of competitor analysis through the use of BuzzSumo.</p><p><strong><em>Why learn this amazing artificial intelligence course and how is this a differentiator for content creators?</em></strong></p><p>This course can change your life if you are a content expert. Because, I will provide you with hands-on experience on creating tons and tons of articles for your blog for inbound marketing using an Artificial Intelligence content tool and you don\u2019t even have to write the content yourself - ever again.

The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.</p><p>One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it. The ability to use it to improve digital marketing strategies and valuable customer insights for companies will be the same as it continues to advance. Excellent customer service is the also most important aspect of an effective digital marketing campaign that this too can be automated by Google Duplex kind of tools that are created in the market.</p><p>Why this secretive course in <strong>\"Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing -&nbsp;Gold Edition\" </strong>- the best one in the industry?</p><p>Artificial intelligence keeps growing and improving and will not slow down for a while. Implementing AI into your digital marketing strategy will help customers experience better and provide your business with the insights it needs to succeed.</p><p>What\u2019s more? The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Many aspects of the production and editing process of videos have been handled by artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Its innovation is also a blessing for production teams and video editors.
