The reason for purchasing real estate varies greatly form person to person, some looking for a long-term home, others looking primarily for an investment, most wanting some mixture of both. Regulations also play a significant role in real estate investing decisions.</p><p>We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems. The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.</p><p>This course will start out with the basics. We will discuss basic real estate terms because every specialized field will have terminology we need to understand to communicate well and make decisions.</p><p>Real estate transactions have many components and players involved. Once we understand the basic terminology, we will discuss how those components and players fit together for a real estate transaction to take place.</p><p>Because real estate is a long-term investment, we need to understand time value of money concepts.

However, of that number, 50,000 applications were rejected, with only 119,428 applications resulting in acceptance into a program.</p><p>For anyone submitting an application in 2014-2015, the chance of success was less than 50%. For applicants who met the admissions criteria and successfully submitted their application, the chance of acceptance was 70%.<br></p><p>The reasons for this high number of unsuccessful applications are mainly twofold. First, there weren\u2019t enough spaces, or funding, available for so many applicants, and second, despite meeting admission criteria, many applicants were beaten by others with better scores.<br></p><p>The good news is that the nursing sector is growing at a rate of 16%, which is quite fast, meaning that nearly half a million new jobs will exist by 2024. The other good news is that you can do a lot of preparation to boost your scores and increase your chances of being accepted into your preferred program.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do I beat the competition?</strong></p><p>Based on the data above, it it safe to assume that from the outset, your application has a 50% chance of being successful. To increase your chances, prepare for the challenges you need to overcome. One of the challenges you have more control over is the TEAS test. If ATI Testing\u2019s TEAS test is part of your application, the following ten steps can help you better prepare and increase your chances of not only getting the grades required, but exceeding them. Beat the competition, boost your confidence, and ace the TEAS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMARTER&nbsp;ACADEMY</strong></p><p><strong><em>Smarter not Harder</em></strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2559756", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "SVG Ultimate Course", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "171", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "112", "students": "64031", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2559756_9c8b_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-svg/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42205", "end_day": "2022-04-25 18:04:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know to Build a Project from Scratch Using SVG", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to code but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to make amazing websites and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then SVG Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Programming is the most in-demand skill in 2021. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start building websites like an expert.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of SVG and how you can</p><p>use them to start building your own websites. </p><p>This is great for students starting or advanced developers that need a refresher course on SVG.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 3 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p><strong>Here is what you will Learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.

It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is a subfield of microbiology.</p><p>The identification of the causative agent of tobacco mosaic disease (TMV) as a novel pathogen by Martinus Beijerinck (1898) is now acknowledged as being the official beginning of the field of virology as a discipline distinct from bacteriology. He realized the source was neither a bacterial nor a fungal infection, but something completely different. Beijerinck used the word \u2018virus\u2019 to describe the mysterious agent in his \u2018contagium vivum fluidum\u2019 (\u2018contagious living fluid\u2019). Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955.</p><p>A major branch of virology is virus classification. Viruses can be classified according to the host cell they infect: animal viruses, plant viruses, fungal viruses, and bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacteria, which include the most complex viruses). Another classification uses the geometrical shape of their capsid (often a helix or an icosahedron) or the virus's structure (e.g. presence or absence of a lipid envelope). Viruses range in size from about 30 nm to about 450 nm, which means that most of them cannot be seen with light microscopes. The shape and structure of viruses has been studied by electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.</p><p>The most useful and most widely used classification system distinguishes viruses according to the type of nucleic acid they use as genetic material and the viral replication method they employ to coax host cells into producing more viruses:</p><ul><li><p>DNA viruses (divided into double-stranded DNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses),</p></li><li><p>RNA viruses (divided into positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and the much less common double-stranded RNA viruses),</p></li><li><p>reverse transcribing viruses (double-stranded reverse-transcribing DNA viruses and single-stranded reverse-transcribing RNA viruses including retroviruses).</p></li></ul><p>Virologists also study <em>subviral particles</em>, infectious entities notably smaller and simpler than viruses:</p><ul><li><p>viroids (naked circular RNA molecules infecting plants),</p></li><li><p>satellites (nucleic acid molecules with or without a capsid that require a helper virus for infection and reproduction), and</p></li><li><p>prions (proteins that can exist in a pathological conformation that induces other prion molecules to assume that same conformation).</p></li></ul><p>Taxa in virology are not necessarily monophyletic, as the evolutionary relationships of the various virus groups remain unclear. Three hypotheses regarding their origin exist:</p><ol><li><p>Viruses arose from non-living matter, separately from yet in parallel to cells, perhaps in the form of self-replicating RNA ribozymes similar to viroids.</p></li><li><p>Viruses arose by genome reduction from earlier, more competent cellular life forms that became parasites to host cells and subsequently lost most of their functionality; examples of such tiny parasitic prokaryotes are Mycoplasma and Nanoarchaea.</p></li><li><p>Viruses arose from mobile genetic elements of cells (such as transposons, retrotransposons or plasmids) that became encapsulated in protein capsids, acquired the ability to \"break free\" from the host cell and infect other cells.</p></li></ol><p>Of particular interest here is mimivirus, a giant virus that infects amoebae and encodes much of the molecular machinery traditionally associated with bacteria. Two possibilities are that it is a simplified version of a parasitic prokaryote or it originated as a simpler virus that acquired genes from its host.</p><p>The evolution of viruses, which often occurs in concert with the evolution of their hosts, is studied in the field of viral evolution.</p><p>While viruses reproduce and evolve, they do not engage in metabolism, do not move, and depend on a host cell for reproduction. The often-debated question of whether they are alive or not is a matter of definition that does not affect the biological reality of viruses.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4589742", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "No-Code Development", "title": "Wordpress Create Your Own Website 2022!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Jenius Inc", "duration": "33", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "29", "students": "5491", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4589742_0383_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-create-a-website-with-wordpress-2022-fast/?couponCode=OPENCOURSE", "end_day": "None", "headline": "Most Easy Way To Create Websites 3 Projects Included!", "description": "<p><strong><em>You're here because you want to create your own WordPress websites, right?</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>You don't Need Coding Ath All no Javascript no html no css no Php</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This WordPress for Beginners course is the perfect place to start.</strong> This complete WordPress course is designed for beginners like you who have never built a WordPress website (or any website for that matter).</p><p>WordPress is the perfect tool for creating a fully customized website for any purpose.

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content. The portal allows you to get Facebook Shares, Pinterest Pins, StumbleUpon (Now known as Mix) likes YouTube views, and Tweets from established social media accounts that are primarily outside of your normal social media marketing channels. This keeps the social media sharing organic and gives your content REAL social media signals! Not only does Google love these types of signals, but it also means more eyeballs on your content (hence more traffic and better branding!</p><p>With Viral Content Bee, one can generate high-quality traffic with free social media promotion!&nbsp;Social media enthusiasts can now increase their blog or video traffic by 200% by putting their content in front of eager social media influencers, worldwide.</p><p>If you are looking to skyrocket your blog traffic in this competitive world and want to learn the trick behind all of this in a very short period of time and start experimenting and applying the simple yet effective techniques taught here, then this course is for you.</p><p>So, why are you waiting to go viral?&nbsp;Join now and let's begin the virality.

However, getting these endorsements isn\u2019t easy, as some require background checks and/or an additional skills test. The written test can be the biggest hurdle since it\u2019s the part over which you have the most control. Below is a list of the different <strong>CDL Practice Tests</strong> that we offer, as well as the accompanying endorsement information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Bus Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The school bus is one of the CDL Types. The School CDL Practice test is a necessary tool for anyone who operates a school bus when loaded with passengers or to/from school-related events. Federal regulations mandate this endorsements for those positions and situations.</p><p><strong>Double/Triple Trailer Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although triple trailers are illegal in some states, the doubles and triples practice test is incredibly helpful in getting the T-endorsement. Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements. However, you can prepare for both of the written tests at the same time with the Combo Tanker and Hazmat Test.<br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3850388", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Human Resources", "title": "Becoming A Recruitment And Selection Specialist", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nevcihan Dogan", "duration": "113", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "495", "students": "48265", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3850388_345f.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/first-steps-into-recruitment-and-selection/?couponCode=APR-22", "end_day": "2022-04-25 19:29:00+00:00", "headline": "It is necessary to have a good recruitment process to attract the right kind of staff for the needs of your business.", "description": "<p>A good recruitment process can reduce the time involved in searching, interviewing, recruiting, and training.

Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4556704", "category": "Design", "sub_category": "Web Design", "title": "C\u00f3mo Crear una Tienda Online con WordPress Desde Cero 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Renato Jes\u00fas Yacolca Neyra", "duration": "94", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "40", "students": "8153", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4556704_fc04.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/como-crear-una-tienda-online-con-wordpress-desde-cero/?couponCode=TIENDA-GR9", "end_day": "2022-04-28 01:48:00+00:00", "headline": "Aprende a c\u00f3mo crear una tienda online con WordPress para vender tus productos por Internet de forma f\u00e1cil y simple.", "description": "<p><strong>\u00bfQUIERES CREAR UNA TIENDA ONLINE CON WORDPRESS Y VENDER TUS PRODUCTOS POR INTERNET?<br><br></strong></p><p>\u00danete a nuestro curso completo para mostrarte c\u00f3mo crear una tienda online profesional y totalmente personalizada en WordPress.

Created and still published by Harcourt Assessment (now a division of Pearson Education), the MAT consists of 120 questions in 60 minutes (formerly 100 questions in 50 minutes).

The MAT is an admissions exam accepted by many graduate programs in the United States. Additionally, it is used by many high-IQ societies all over the world as an admission requirement. The MAT goal is to assess logical and analytical reasoning through completion of partial analogies. The test duration is 1 hour and contains 120 questions. Exam formats include both <strong>Computer-Based Tests (CBT)</strong> and paper and pencil format.</p><p>This free practice exam features realistic questions that will help you not only review key vocabulary, but also familiarize yourself with the MAT\u2019s 120 Analogy exam format. This exam is also very good preparation for those preparing for the GRE Test, as both exams cover analogies.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>The MAT is a one hundred item, fifty minute verbal analogies test. All of the questions will be in the form of A:B:C:D. The analogies are written so that A is to B as C is to D. However, your job will be to fill in the missing term by correctly identifying the relationship that exists.</p><p><strong>Test Centers, Dates, and Fees</strong></p><p>Currently, there are more than six hundred testing centers in fifty states as well as in several foreign countries. If you live more than one hundred miles away from a designated test center, special accommodations can be made. Dates will vary by testing site, so be sure to consult with the test site. The average fee to take the MAT is about $50, though that varies by region.</p><p><strong>Scores</strong></p><p>When you register to take the MAT, you are asked to provide up to three addresses that you wish to have your score reports sent. Sending your test scores to three schools is included in the test administration fee. However, it is your responsibility to provide accurate addresses for the schools.</p><p><strong>History of the MAT</strong></p><p>According to the Miller Analogies Test Manual (1970) the test was developed to measure scholastic aptitude at the graduate school level. It is also developed to measure how well the test taker can recognize relationships between words.</p><p>Vocabulary plays a very important role on this test.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now involved in the creation of smart video and has also been able to influence businesses. Users can now film and edit videos through Artificial Intelligence. It also brings many job opportunities in the field. Due to its ability to sense, reason, act and adapt, AI has suddenly become one of the most important technologies and the most in-demand tool for the video creation market; and also due to the popularity of automation in different business practices. Several companies have invested in keeping video production as their main target in Artificial Intelligence. Examples include AI implementation and deployment through multiple video distribution channels such as Netflix and YouTube. These companies have invested in AI just to make it more exciting and innovative to watch videos. Many aspects of the production and editing process of videos have been handled by artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Its innovation is also a blessing for production teams and video editors. It helps practitioners to concentrate more on creative aspects instead of editing which is perceived by many to be a very dull and repetitive job.</p><p><em>Did you also know this fact?</em></p><p>Most aspects of the production and distribution system are managed by artificial intelligence. It can now record, edit, pick and distribute online videos. Artificial intelligence has allowed automated video editing in 2022. A camera can now operate on its own without human instructions.&nbsp;Ok, so what does this&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Video&nbsp;Creation course cover?&nbsp;Let's look into this further.&nbsp;Here is the ultimate question. </p><p><strong><em>Why learn this mind-blowing course and how this can be a differentiator when it comes to AI-powered video creation?</em></strong></p><p>With Biteable,&nbsp;you can convert any plain infographic into fun slides that will not only explain and pass the information but also make the content more understandable.

The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3684024", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Digital Products Mastery 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Henry Zhang", "duration": "47", "rating": "3.6", "reviews": "35", "students": "19006", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3684024_3d1e_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-products-mini-course/?couponCode=0D47212A218A9FBFFD2C", "end_day": "2022-04-25 23:07:00+00:00", "headline": "How to create highly profitable digital products to sell online and build a successful online business easily & quickly!", "description": "<p><strong>If you\u2019ve been looking for a fast and easy way to build a profitable online business, look no further than digital products.</strong></p><p>Digital products are not only easy to create, but they can be easily replicated and turned into multiple product lines that fuel an unlimited number of sales funnels.</p><p>They\u2019re also consistently in demand, easy to deliver, and if you never want to write a line of content yourself, you can affordably outsource everything!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Digital Products Course For EVERY Level</strong></p><p>This course is your fast track to digital products success and will provide long-lasting value from your very first products you start right through to advanced enterprise campaigns.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report.

It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.</p><p>In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).</p><p>Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2039416", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "CSS3 Ultimate Course", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "370", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "963", "students": "160972", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2039416_c660_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-css-course/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42205", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:32:00+00:00", "headline": "CSS3 For Web Development: Quickly Master CSS3 By Building A Project From Scratch", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to code but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to make amazing websites and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then CSS3 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Programming is the most in-demand skill in 2021. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start building websites like an expert.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of CSS3 and how you can style your own websites. </p><p>This is great for students starting or advanced developers that need a refresher course on CSS3.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 6 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p><strong>Here is what you will Learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3694088", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Amazon Associates Mastery 2022 | Full Blueprint From 0 to 1!", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Henry Zhang", "duration": "46", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "37", "students": "19692", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3694088_3626_8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/amazon-affiliate-mini-course/?couponCode=1F5F32BF386EFA6543FD", "end_day": "2022-04-25 23:07:00+00:00", "headline": "How to start affiliate marketing leads that convert every time for long-lasting sustainable success and steady income !", "description": "<p><strong>Amazon Affiliate Marketing 2021 - NO Website Needed!</strong> is the <strong>ONLY</strong> guide you\u2019ll ever need for starting your lucrative affiliate marketing career from scratch with ZERO prior experience or skill.</p><p>Learn all the inside hacks and proven strategies that will maximize your earning potential from visitors to your website with little or no cost and effort.</p><p>Set yourself apart from the competition and make sure your leads convert every time for long-lasting sustainable success and a steady income stream!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Amazon Affiliate Course For EVERY Level</strong></p><p>This course is your fast track to Amazon Affiliate success and will provide long-lasting value from your very first product promotion right through to advanced sales and marketing campaigns.</p><p><br></p><p>Join now and you\u2019ll learn how to:</p><ul><li><p>Uncover the secrets of <strong>making big money</strong> promoting simple products on Amazon as an affiliate!</p></li><li><p>Find out how to get<strong> tons of traffic </strong>without having to depend on Google's crazy rules!</p></li><li><p>Discover the secrets to choosing the right products to promote for the <strong>most income possible!</strong></p></li><li><p>Learn how to promote products <strong>without spending a single dime</strong> on paid traffic!</p></li><li><p><strong><em>And much more</em></strong> - all within this special<strong> course</strong>!</p></li></ul><p>Plus, SO much more!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>No experience or prior skill required.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We\u2019ll cover strategies that grow your business from the ground up and we\u2019ll even show you how to make money from Amazon as you learn!</p><p><br></p><p>Remember you need ZERO prior experience or skill to join this course.

The abbreviation \"IQ\" was coined by the psychologist William Stern for the German term <em>Intelligenzquotient</em>, his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912 book.</p><p>Historically, IQ was a score obtained by dividing a person's mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person's chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months. The resulting fraction (quotient) was multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score. For modern IQ tests, the raw score is transformed to a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15.This results in approximately two-thirds of the population scoring between IQ 85 and IQ 115 and about 2.5 percent each above 130 and below 70.</p><p>Scores from intelligence tests are estimates of intelligence. Unlike, for example, distance and mass, a concrete measure of intelligence cannot be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of \"intelligence\".IQ scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as nutrition,[8][9] parental socioeconomic status,morbidity and mortality,[12][13] parental social status,[14] and perinatal environment.While the heritability of IQ has been investigated for nearly a century, there is still debate about the significance of heritability estimates[16][17] and the mechanisms of inheritance.</p><p>IQ scores are used for educational placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants. In research contexts, they have been studied as predictors of job performance and income.They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2870128", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Other Office Productivity", "title": "QuickBooks Online Not for Profit Organization", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "603", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "50", "students": "16862", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2870128_3707.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-online-not-for-profit-organization/?couponCode=BC48E9420045F51A67CE", "end_day": "2022-04-28 06:07:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Not for Profit accounting using QuickBooks Online from a practicing CPA", "description": "<p>Learners will understand how to set up QuickBooks Online for a Not for Profit Organization.</p><p>The course will show how to use free resources to optimize learning.</p><p>We will demonstrate the use of class tracking to generate Not for Profit reports.</p><p>Learners will see how to create and use donation receipt forms.</p><p>We will show how to create and use pledge receipt forms.</p><p>The course will demonstrate how to enter and track restricted resources.</p><p>We will enter month end adjusting entries.</p><p>Learners will see how to allocate expenses to programs and administrative categories.</p><p>We will record net assets released from restriction.</p><p>The course will show how to generate, analyze, memorize, &amp; export to Excel financial reports.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2394016", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Certified Ethical Hacker v11: Crash Course Practice Test!", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Pratik Powar", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "96", "students": "18290", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2394016_5605.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-ethical-hacker-v11-crash-course-practice-test/?couponCode=4C3933E9FCEC79F37B09", "end_day": "2022-04-28 17:25:00+00:00", "headline": "Practice the questions for CEHv11 certification exam or renew your knowledge of CEH earlier versions", "description": "<p>In this practice test questions for CEHv11, you will dive into the real world questions to help prepare yourself for the CEHv11 certification exam. there are similar MCQs practice questions and you have to understand the questions then answer them accordingly.

Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called <em>edges</em>. Neurons and edges typically have a <em>weight</em> that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.</p><p><strong>Deep learning</strong> (also known as <strong>deep structured learning</strong>) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p><p>Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.</p><p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue.</p><p>The adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the \"structured\" part.</p><p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to <strong>natural intelligence</strong> displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.</p><p>Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.</p><p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p><p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3867842", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Test Prep", "title": "2022 American College Testing ACT\u00ae TOP Practice Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "4", "students": "5532", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3867842_3b5b.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/american-college-testing-act-top-practice-tests/?couponCode=0A28E70BC6BA2E5295AE", "end_day": "2022-04-25 16:54:00+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily 2021 American College Testing ACT\u00ae TOP Practice Tests", "description": "<p><strong><em>Welcome !</em></strong></p><p><strong>American College Testing ACT\u00ae TOP Practice Tests</strong></p><p><strong>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The ACT\u00ae includes more than one-preference tests in four areas: <strong>English</strong>, <strong>Mathematics, Reading,</strong> and <strong>Science</strong>.

The complex nature of the human anatomy requires people to understand each and every part of the body. How? By dissecting it. Reverse engineering is a way for us to understand how things were designed, why is it in its state, when it triggers, how it works, and what its purpose is. In effect, the information is used to redesign and improve for better performance and cost. It can even help fix defects.</p><p>It is amazing, and rather disconcerting, to realize how much software we run without knowing for sure what it does. We buy software off the shelf in shrink wrapped packages. We run setup utilities that install numerous files, change system settings, delete or disable older versions and superseded utilities, and modify critical registry files. Every time we access a Website, we may invoke or interact with dozens of programs and code segments that are necessary to give us the intended look, feel, and behaviour. We purchase CDs with hundreds of games and utilities or download them as shareware. We exchange useful programs with colleagues and friends when we have tried only a fraction of each program\u2019s features. Then, we download updates and install patches, trusting that the vendors are sure that the changes are correct and complete. We blindly hope that the latest change to each program keeps it compatible with all of the rest of the programs on our system. We rely on much software that we do not understand and do not know very well at all. I refer to a lot more than our desktop or laptop personal computers. The concept of ubiquitous computing, or \u201csoftware everywhere,\u201d is rapidly putting software control and interconnection in devices throughout our environment. The average automobile now has more lines of software code in its engine controls than were required to land the Apollo astronauts on the Moon.</p><p>Malware analysis is the study of malware's behaviour. The objective of malware analysis is to understand the working of malware and how to detect and eliminate it. It involves analysing the suspect binary in a safe environment to identify its characteristics and functionalities so that better defences can be built to protect an organization's network.</p><p>Imagine if the Trojan Horse was thoroughly inspected and torn down before it was allowed to enter the gates of a city. This would probably cause a few dead soldiers outside the gate fighting for the city. The next time the city is sent another Trojan Horse, archers would know where to point their arrows. And no dead soldiers this time. The same is true for malware analysis\u2014by knowing the behaviours of a certain malware through reverse engineering, the analyst can recommend various safeguards for the network. Think of it as the Trojan Horse being the malware, the analyst being the soldier who initially inspected the horse, and the city being the network of computers.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3604998", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "HTML Certification, Practice Test For Exams & Interviews", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Pawan Saini", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "303", "students": "13063", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3604998_86bf_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/html-certification-practice-test-for-exams-interviews-z/?couponCode=BDD8BC4D5461C8381C80", "end_day": "2022-04-29 02:03:00+00:00", "headline": "This course includes basic & and advanced questions about HTML, HTML5 that will help you in exams &  job interviews", "description": "<p>This <strong>HTML practice</strong> test includes <strong>multiple-choice questions and answers</strong>(MCQs).

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.</p><p>Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps <em>the</em> oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.</p><p>Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.</p><p><br></p><p>Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.</p><p>Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialized, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"Universalists\" such as Einstein (1879\u20131955) and Lev Landau (1908\u20131968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4077590", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Facebook Marketing Mastery 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Henry Zhang", "duration": "69", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "27", "students": "9394", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4077590_984c_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/henry-zhang-facebook-marketing-mini-course/?couponCode=7A75241AEB28DFE8BF36", "end_day": "2022-04-25 23:11:00+00:00", "headline": "How to promote your business on Facebook and engage in Facebook marketing with a higher than average chance of success!", "description": "<p><strong>Facebook is a massive traffic monster.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science.

It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.</p><p>In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).</p><p>Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2892636", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Xero Not for Profit Organization", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "534", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "19", "students": "18769", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2892636_fec5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/xero-not-for-profit-organization/?couponCode=D1DC106ACD2FA50F9220", "end_day": "2022-04-28 06:06:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Not for Profit accounting using Xero from a practicing CPA", "description": "<p>Learners will understand how to set up Xero for a Not for Profit Organization.</p><p>The course will show how to use free resources to optimize learning.</p><p>We will demonstrate the use of category tracking to generate Not for Profit reports.</p><p>Learners will see how to create and use donation receipt forms.</p><p>We will show how to create and use pledge receipt forms.</p><p>The course will demonstrate how to enter and track restricted resources.</p><p>We will enter month end adjusting entries.</p><p>Learners will see how to allocate expenses to programs and administrative categories.</p><p>We will record net assets released from restriction.</p><p>The course will show how to generate, analyze, memorize, &amp; export to Excel financial reports.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3737008", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "QuickBooks Enterprise - Two Businesses & Personal in One", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "290", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "34", "students": "18083", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3737008_667f_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-enterprise-2020-two-businesses-personal-in-one/?couponCode=3FB4B2887DB5894D5BBB", "end_day": "2022-04-28 06:00:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to track both balance sheet and profit and loss activity for multiple companies & personal finances", "description": "<p>This is a project-based course that will use the free trial version of QuickBooks Enterprise to track multiple business financial data as well as personal financial data in one QuickBooks Enterprise file.

It takes courage, endeavor and commitment<br>to live in a new country and participate fully as a citizen. We value your contribution to our peaceful and<br>democratic society. Australian citizenship is an important step in your migration story.</p><p>The <strong>Australian citizenship test</strong> plays a valuable role in encouraging people to find out more about Australia, as well as understanding the responsibilities and privileges being an Australian citizen brings. All the information you need to pass the test is in the citizenship test resource Australian Citizenship: Our Common Bond.</p><p><br></p><p>About Australia Citizenship Practice Test:</p><p>\u2013 The test is in English<br>\u2013 consists of 20 multiple choice questions, and<br>\u2013 You must answer %75 of the questions correct in order to pass.<br>\u2013 There is not a separate English language test but you will need a basic knowledge of English to pass the test.</p><p>Before you can set the citizenship test, you must apply for citizenship. Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007. The citizenship test was implemented on 1 October 2007.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2853162", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Microsoft", "title": "Microsoft 365 Ultimate Course 2021", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "1347", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "2396", "students": "178521", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2853162_5088.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-microsoft-office-365/?couponCode=TRY1000FREE42205", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:54:00+00:00", "headline": "Everything you need to know about Microsoft 365 for 2021", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn Microsoft 365 but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to manager accounts and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then Microsoft 365 2021 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Microsoft 365 is an in-demand skill in 2021. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start adding accounts like an expert with Microsoft 365.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of Microsoft 365. </p><p>This is great for students starting or for IT Personal that need a refresher course on Microsoft 365.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 22 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p><strong>Here's What You'll Learn:</strong> </p><p><strong>01.

The test has just been updated for February 2021. This is the first test in a series that covers the knowledge and skills of basic nursing you\u2019ll need as a new certified nursing assistant (CNA). The questions are based on the same categories that are included in the official exam. The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint. If you still make a mistake, you\u2019ll see the correct response displayed along with an explanation to help you understand. If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator. The skills test portion is about 35-45 minutes and covers five or more skills.</p><p><strong>Alternate names:</strong></p><p>A CNA test is also known as:</p><ul><li><p>Certified Nursing Assistant examination</p></li><li><p>Nursing assistant test</p></li><li><p>CNA knowledge test</p></li><li><p>CNA exam</p></li><li><p>Nurse assistant test</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why CNAs are important</strong></p><p>Certified Nursing Assistants are vital members of the health care team. Your skills can keep your patients safe and comfortable. Your ability to provide hands-on care means that you may be the first to notice changes in your patients. You have a lot to learn, but we are here to help. Start with the basic skills. Nearly everything builds from there. As you learn, you will become a valuable team member. Remember that health care would not be possible without the CNA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CNA \u2013 A Certified Nursing Assistant</strong> is a nurse that helps patients with healthcare needs under the supervision of a <strong>Registered Nurse</strong> (RN) or a <strong>Licensed Practical Nurse</strong> (LPN). Also known as a <strong>Nursing Assistant</strong> (NA) a <strong>Patient Care Assistant</strong> (PCA) or a <strong>State Tested Nurse Aid</strong> (STNA), the individual who carries this title needs a strong work ethic and ability, but issues of liability and legality prevent CNA\u2019s from performing certain procedures.</p><p>We have the Best Free <strong>CNA Practice Test Online</strong>.<br>These are full-length practice exams with challenging questions.

Udemy generally provides lifetime access to the course.</p><p>Many accounting students do not receive a physical book, they get to keep from their school, and even if they did, the information could become dated. Students who want a useful reference tool they can keep, and one that can be more easily updated then a textbook, will benefit from a resource such as this.</p><p>Financial accounting is a LARGE topic and is not something that can be done well in 5, 10, or 20, hours of content, as you may see claimed elsewhere. We will cover accounting theory because theory and concepts are what accounting is. We need to learn theory so we can make appropriate adjustments in the real world. Learning procedures without understanding the theory will make us inflexible and unable to adapt to the ever-changing environment. We will learn the theory while we apply them to procedures.</p><p>Financial accounting is relatively standardized in format. In other words, most accounting institutions will cover much the same topics, often in much the same order. We suggest looking up a standard accounting textbook, checking the index, and comparing the topics to the courses you are considering purchasing. We believe this course will line up well to anybody\u2019s needs who want to learn financial accounting.</p><p>Below is a list of topics by section:</p><p>Section SEC 1 An Introduction to Accounting, The Double Entry Accounting System, &amp; Recording Transactions using Debits and Credits</p><p>Section SEC 2 \u2013 Recording Period End Adjusting Entries</p><p>Section SEC 3 \u2013 Recording Closing Entries</p><p>Section SEC 4 - Merchandising Transactions \u2013 Transactions Involving Inventory</p><p>Section SEC 5 \u2013 Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average Methods)</p><p>Section SEC 6 \u2013 Subsidiary Ledgers &amp; Special Journals</p><p>Section SEC 7 \u2013 Bank Reconciliations &amp; Cash Internal Controls</p><p>Section SEC 8 \u2013 Accounts Receivable \u2013 Allowance Method &amp; Direct Write Off Methods</p><p>Section SEC 9 \u2013 Depreciation Methods &amp; Property Plant &amp; Equipment</p><p>Section SEC 10 \u2013 Payroll Accounting</p><p>Section SEC 11 \u2013 Partnership Accounting</p><p>Section SEC 12 \u2013 Accounting for Corporations</p><p>Section SEC 13 \u2013 Bonds Payable, Notes Payable, &amp; Long-Term Liabilities</p><p>Section SEC 14 \u2013 Statement of Cash Flows</p><p>The course will start off at the basics and work all the way through the financial accounting topics generally covered in an undergraduate program.</p><p>First, we will describe what financial accounting is and the objectives of financial accounting. We will learn how the double-entry accounting system works by applying it to the accounting equation. In other words, we will use an accounting equation to record financial transactions using a double-entry accounting system.</p><p>We well learn all topics by fist having presentations and then applying the skills using Excel practice problems. If you are not familiar with how to navigate through Excel, it is OK. We will use preformatted worksheets, have step by step instructional videos, and will start off relatively slow.</p><p>The next step is to apply the double-entry accounting system using debits and credits. Debits and credits are a new concept to most people not familiar with accounting, or possibly worse, many people have misconceptions about the meaning of debit and credit due to its use in areas like bank statements, credit cards, and debit cards.</p><p>We will cover the rules related to debits and credits in a lot of detail. We will then record similar transactions we had done using the accounting equation, but now using debits and credits.</p><p>After we get good at recording transactions using debits and credits, we will learn period end adjusting entries. Adjusting entries are used to adjust the books to represent an accrual basis at the period end better, and they are a great tool for enforcing the concepts of accrual accounting.</p><p>Next, we will use the data we have learned to put together by recording financial transactions into financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. We will learn to construct a statement of cash flows much later in the course.</p><p>After completing the financial statements, we will learn how to journalize and post-closing entries. Closing entries are used to clean out temporary accounts and prepare for the transactions that will be recorded in the next period.</p><p>The steps we have just outlined are critically important to all accounting, and we will need a reasonably good understanding of them to move forward. In other words, the better we understand these concepts, the more natural learning the rest of financial accounting will be. We recommend spending a good deal of time on these concepts and reviewing them often. Think of these skills as a baseball player thinks of playing catch or a musician thinks of playing the basic scales. We should put in some practice with the basics every day.</p><p>Next, we will add inventory to the mix. All the skills we have learned will still apply, but we will now record transactions related to the purchase and sale of inventory.</p><p>We will also learn to track inventory using different methods. We can use specific identification. In other words, we can track the exact unit of inventory that was sold as a car dealership would do. However, companies generally use a cost flow assumption with smaller items that are the same in nature, assumptions like First In Fist Out (FIFO) or Last In Last Out (LIFO). A company may also use a weighted average method.</p><p>Next well will consider subsidiary ledger and special journals. Our main focus is on subsidiary ledger related to accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accounts receivable represents money owed to the organization.</p><p>The general ledger will provide the transactions that make up the accounts receivable account balance by date. However, we will want to see this data reported by customers, so we know who owes the company money and how much, and this is the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger.</p><p>We have a similar situation with accounts payable. Accounts payable represent vendors the company owes money to. We will want to sort this information by vendors, so we know which vendors we owe money to and how much.</p><p>Next, we will cover bank reconciliation and internal controls related to cash. The bank reconciliation is one of the most important internal controls outside of the double-entry accounting system itself. All businesses, large and small, should perform a bank reconciliation. The bank reconciliation will reconcile the cash balance on the company\u2019s books to the cash balance reported by the bank as of a specific date, the date of the bank statement, typically the end of the month.</p><p>The bank statement balance will not agree to the book balance due to outstanding items, items recorded by the company, but which have not yet cleared the bank. The outstanding items will be the reconciling items in a bank reconciliation.</p><p>Next will learn how to value accounts receivable and deal with those accounts we will not be able to collect on. In other words, accounts receivable represent money owed to the business for work done in the past. However, some of those receivables may not ever be paid. How do we account for the a customers we do not think will pay and how do we value the accounts receivable account if we believe some of the receivable will may not be collected in the future, but we do not know which ones?</p><p>GAAP generally requires the use of what is called the allowance method to value accounts receivable. We will compare the allowance method to the direct write off method, an easier method but one that does not conform to accrual accounting as well.</p><p>Next, we will cover property plant and equipment. The most difficult concept related to property plant and equipment is calculating and recording depreciation. Deprecation can be calculated using different methods, including the straight-line method, the double-declining balance method, and the units of production method. We will compare and contrast each method in detail.</p><p>We will also consider how to record the purchase and sale of property plant and equipment.</p><p>Next, we will discuss the tracking and reporting of payroll. Payroll is a very large topic because of the payroll laws included in it. We will discuss how to calculate payroll taxes, including federal income tax FIT, social security, and Medicare. We will record journal entries related to payroll. Payroll journal entries are some of the longest and most complex journal entries recorded in the standard accounting cycle.</p><p>Next, we will learn partnership accounting. The concepts we learned related to the double-entry accounting system will apply to partnerships. Our focus now will be on those transactions unique to a partnership form of entity. For example, we will discuss how to allocate net income to each partners capital account. A partnership type of entity is very flexible, and there are many different ways partners can agree on to allocate income.</p><p>We will discuss how to record transactions when a new partner is added to a partnership or when an existing partner leaves a partnership.</p><p>We will also cover how to record the liquidation of a partnership. Much of the liquidation process will apply to the closing of other business entity types as well. However, the partnership type of entity has the added difficulty of allocating the final proceeds to the partners in accordance with their capital accounts.</p><p>Then we will consider transaction unique to a corporation format of entity. Like the partnership form of entity, the corporation will use the same double-entry accounting system we learned at the beginning of the course. In this section, we will learn how to record the sale of capital stock and the sale of preferred stock. We will record transaction related to the purchase of treasury stock. We will discuss how to record cash dividends and stock dividends.</p><p>Then we will learn concepts related to bonds payable, notes payable, and long term liabilities. Many people are familiar with bonds as a type of investment. We will consider bonds from the other side of the transaction with the issuance of bonds. Bonds are often used as a tool to understand the time-value of money concept and interest rates at a deeper level. Therefore, even if you do not plan on recording many transactions related to the issuance of bonds, it is a useful process to learn valuable concepts. Bonds are often issued at a premium or a discount. The premium or discount is then amortized over the life of the bond.</p><p>We will discuss how to record the initial sale of the bond. We will talk about how to amortize the bond discount and premium. We will record transactions related to bond interest, and we will discuss transactions for the dissolution of the bonds.</p><p>The course will also cover the recording of notes payable. One of the most complex components of notes payable is the breaking out of interest and principal portion of the payment. For the task of breaking out interest and principal, we will need an amortization schedule. We will build amortization schedules from scratch, a useful skill to understand.</p><p>The second complication with notes payable is breaking out the current and long term portion of the note. We will use the amortization schedule to perform the task of calculating the current and long term portion of the notes payable.</p><p>Finally, we will discuss how to create a statement of cash flows. The statement of cash flows is on the of primary financial statements along with the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity, but the statement of cash flows can be more complicated to construct.</p><p>The statement of cash flows represents the flow of cash broken out into three categories, operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. We have constructed the financial statements using an accrual basis rather than a cash basis. We can think of the statement of cash flows as converting the accrual basis to a cash basis.</p><p>We can use two methods when constructing the operating section of the statement of cash flows, the direct method, and the indirect method. The indirect method is more common and often required, even if we also add the direct method. The indirect method starts with net income in then backs into cash flow from operations.</p><p><strong>Sample of part to test in the book that comes with the course: </strong></p><p>The first questions asked when introduced to any new topic are often:</p><p>\u2022 What is it?</p><p>\u2022 Why do I need to know it?</p><p>We will address the second question first: why do I need to know accounting?</p><p>Answer: Because it\u2019s fun. Because accounting is fun is likely not the first thing that popped into your mind, but we want to start off with this concept, the idea of thinking of accounting as a kind of game, a sort of puzzle, something we can figure out. Thinking of accounting as a game will make learning accounting much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Accounting </strong>can be defined as an \u201cinformation and measurement system that identifies, records, and communicates relevant information about a company\u2019s business activities\u201d<strong> </strong>(John J. Wild, 2015).</p><p>The process of accounting includes the accumulation of data into a relevant form, which can be used for practical decision making.</p><p>Data is often identified using forms and documents such as bills, invoices, and timesheets. Once identified information is input into an accounting system, often an electronic one. The end goal of financial accounting is the creation of financial statements including a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. The financial statements are used to make relevant decisions.</p><p>There are many reasons to learn accounting concepts, other than it being fun, although we always want to keep the fun factor in mind. Some of the most obvious reasons for learning accounting include:</p><p>\u00b7 Accounting provides a format to understand business whether we are in the accounting department or not. Accounting is the language of business, a way of communicating business objectives and performance. All areas and departments benefit from understanding accounting because it provides a way to communicate between departments and communication is critical to business success.</p><p>\u00b7 Accounting concepts apply to our personal finances. We all need to deal with our personal finances and learning basic accounting concepts and recording techniques helps ease our mind when dealing with our financial tasks.</p><p>Other reasons for learning accounting, which are not so obvious, include that accounting is a great tool to help develop critical thinking skills. Accounting requires reasoning to work through problems, and the practice of accounting will refine reasoning abilities and help us approach problems in a more systematic way, a more efficient way.</p><p>Accounting can also provide the same sense of satisfaction we receive when completing a puzzle, when mastering a new musical pattern, or when playing a game skillfully. Accounting can provide the same shot of dopamine when we figure out a problem, discern how something works and can claim that the double entry accounting system is in balance.</p><p><strong>Accounting can be compared to a game of checkers</strong></p><p>For example, the game of checkers starts with setting up pieces on a board, a spreadsheet, following a set of rules. To set up the board, we need to have memorized the rules for doing so. Memorizing rules is not the fun aspect of checkers but is a necessary one to receiving the enjoyment of playing the game. Once the board is set up the game of checkers is played by moving pieces according to a set of rules to achieve a certain objective, the elimination of opponent\u2019s pieces.</p><p>Accounting is similar in that we will start off by learning how to set up the board, the accounting board being a T account or ledger. As with checkers, we will need to memorize where the pieces fit on the board, which side of the T account pieces will line up on. Accounting pieces are the accounts and account types which have a normal balance lining up on the left or right side of the board, of the T account or ledger.</p><p>Once we know the normal balance of accounts, we will play the accounting game by applying debits and credits to the accounts following a set of rules which have a particular objective, the creation of relevant information, the creation of financial statements.</p><p><strong>The major obstacles for learning accounting are the same as those for learning music.</strong></p><p>The primary obstacle to learning accounting concepts is the memorization of rules, a simple task, but one most do not find very enjoyable.</p><p>Memorizing rules is the same obstacle holding people back from learning many fulfilling activities, activities like learning music, or a new language. Rules of some kind must be learned to play music. The idea of rules, of structure, of constraints, seems counter-intuitive to the concept of creativity we associate with creating and playing music, but rules, structure, and limitations are often requirements for creativity. For example, writing and especially poetry, requires adherence to strict rules and many great writers have done their best work while constrained by deadlines and editors.</p><p>Whether it be notes, chords, or songs rote memorization is required before these learned concepts can be used to create something new, to create or play music, the structure critically contributing to the creation process. Creating, of course, is the fun part, the fulfilling part, the area to look forward to but memorization is a necessary part, a critical part, and a part well worth the effort.</p><p><strong>Confidence in the system is required to learn accounting</strong></p><p>Education is all about asking questions, testing theories, and being skeptical of claims given without a convincing argument, without supporting facts. Accounting is no different. Questioning is essential to setting up an efficient accounting system, but the tradition of questioning can also be used as a crutch, as an excuse for not moving forward and finding our mistakes.</p><p>I recommend accounting students start out having faith that the double entry accounting system works, in a similar way that we have faith that a 1,000 piece puzzle will contain all the pieces required and can be constructed to match the picture on box, because without this confidence we will lose the motivation to move forward, to complete the task, and therefore miss out on the enjoyment of completing the project.</p><p>Confidence in the double entry accounting system is necessary when first learning accounting concepts because doubting the system restricts us from moving forward to complete the necessary steps and look for the mistakes we have made. It is much easier to claim that the system does not work then look for the more likely problem, our own errors.</p><p>Having faith in a system does not mean we should not question a system. Questions are always encouraged, at all times, but it is best to give the concepts the benefit of the doubt and not allow our questioning of the system to be an excuse, a crutch, for not completing a task or figuring out a problem.</p><p>The double entry accounting system has been around for a long time, at least since the Franciscan monk Luca Pacioli around 1494, and while this does not prove its correctness it does show that it has been a useful tool to many in the past, and will therefore likely be a useful tool to many in the future.</p><p>Accounting is divided into two major groups; Financial Accounting &amp; Managerial Accounting.</p><p><strong>Financial accounting </strong>has the end goal of generating financial statements, financial statements designed with external user needs in mind. The aim of financial accounting toward external users may seem strange at first because financial data is required and used for internal, managerial, decision making as well but external users have needs that require more reliance on financial statements in many ways.</p><p><strong>External users</strong> are users outside the company and include investors, creditors, the internal revenues service, and customers. Companies need these external users for things such as investments, loans, and to follow laws and regulations.</p><p>External users do not have intimate knowledge of the business and therefore need assurance to increase the level of trust, trust being a necessary component for business transactions to take place. To increase confidence levels, financial statements are required to follow a strict format of rules designed to standardize the financial reporting. Standardization allows for the comparison of financial information across time and between different companies.</p><p><strong>Managerial accounting</strong> has the goal of generating relevant information for internal decision makers to make sound decisions, for management.</p><p>Managerial accounting does include the use of the same financial information generated in financial accounting, but information is not required to be in a particular format, managerial accounting being less regulated. Management has intimate knowledge of the company, and therefore there is less need for regulations on the format of data and information. Management will determine the best format for managerial statements to assist in making the best decisions.</p><p>Because managerial accounting is less regulated, it is commonly thought that managerial accounting will differ greatly from organization to organization. While it is true that managerial accounting practices will vary from company to company, there are also best practices which are applied, practices that have stood the test of time, those that have helped good companies be great. The study of managerial accounting is the study of best practices used to make good business decisions.</p><p>Financial accounting developed in much the same way, businesses looking for best practices to compile data for both themselves and external users. Over time financial accounting has solidified those best practices into a standardized form. Standardization often limits innovation but does provide a clear format for external users, this being one of the tradeoffs related to regulation. We will talk more about the need for standardization in a profession like accounting when we discuss what a profession is and the need for ethics and regulations within a profession.</p><p>Ethics plays a huge role in accounting as it does in most professions, in part, because ethics deals with trust and trust is an essential component of any business transaction. The concept of ethics is very broad, has been studied intensely since ancient times, and is an area which still has many open questions, but ethics related to accounting can be narrowed from the broader discussion in some ways.</p><p>One way to think of ethics as it relates to a profession is by implementing a kind of categorical imperative, acting in a way that we would wish to be universal for the entire profession. For example, stealing could benefit an individual but if everyone steals everyone is worse off and therefore stealing would be wrong.</p><p>Similarly acting in a way that is misleading could lead to gains for an individual but doing so harms the profession and is therefore wrong. Most professions can apply a concept like this. two of the oldest professions are law and medicine. The reason professions are needed in areas like law, medicine, and accounting is because they deal with specialized knowledge, knowledge most people do not have and that many are dependent on at some point in their lives. An uneven distribution of knowledge can cause incentives for individuals to seek short term gains through deceit.</p><p>For example, somebody claiming to know medicine could administer medicine that is not effective and the patient would not know, a patient having no choice but to trust the expertise of the doctor. If a physician abuses trust by administering remedies that are not effective, they are profiting off the name of the profession, from the brand of the occupation, and if this practice is done enough, it will result in a lack of trust in medicine.</p><p>A similar scenario can be painted for many areas of accounting, accounting having advanced to a specialized field, one that most do not understand, but are forced to deal in at some point or another. The need for trust drives and incentivizes a profession to self-regulate, to build a brand. One way the accounting profession self-regulates is by requiring different certifications to practice in different areas, certifications like a certified public accountant CPA license. A certification process helps provide the public with a level of trust that an individual has some basic understanding of concepts they are dealing with and provides ethical standards that must be met.</p><p>An example of the need for trust in accounting is when investors use financial statements to make investment decisions. Publicly traded stocks have an increased need for transparency in their financial reporting because their stock is being sold and traded by the public, a huge benefit to both companies and investors, providing capital to companies, and opportunities for gain to investors.</p><p>For an individual to invest, however, they need to analyze their options, and financial statements are the primary tool for this analysis. If investors do not have confidence in the numbers reported on the financial statements, do not understand how the numbers are reported, or cannot compare the numbers to related companies, investment transactions will decline due to a lack of information and trust.</p><p>The economy needs trust in the system as a major component which keeps interactions taking place, compelling people to take calculated risks, driving individuals to do business and drive growth and innovation.</p><p>Fraud is one component in the discussion of ethics, fraud being the deliberate attempt to deceive for personal gain. Fraud can take many forms in business from theft to falsifying the financial statements to drive up stock prices and increase bonus pay.</p><p>Most people believe fraud is all about employing the right people, honest people, those with integrity. While the right people is a huge component, it is not the only one. Good people in a bad environment or culture can fall victim to the group mentality. Businesses can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing conditions that foster fraud and taking active steps in reducing them.</p><p>A criminologist has introduced the idea of a <strong>fraud triangle</strong>, consisting of three factors which increase the likelihood of fraud. <strong>Fraud factors</strong> include <strong>opportunity</strong>, <strong>pressure</strong>, and <strong>rationalization</strong>.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong> means that the ability to commit fraud and not be caught is present, or at least perceived. For example, if a company had a policy of keeping their petty cash fund in a shoebox in the middle of the lunch room the opportunity for theft without detection would be greater than if the money was put into a more secure location.</p><p><strong>Pressure</strong> or incentive means that a person is under pressure of some kind, often financial. If money if tight the likelihood of an individual committing fraud is significantly increased.</p><p><strong>Rationalization </strong>is when a person justifies an action. Our minds are excellent at rationalizing. We generally believe that we think before acting, but we often act and then justify the action through rationalization. Rationalization is one reason fraud tends to continue, and even escalate over time.</p><p>For example, if a company left the petty cash in the lunchroom an employee may rationalize theft by reasoning that it\u2019s the company\u2019s fault for not better safeguarding their assets. While it may be true that leaving cash in the middle of the lunchroom is not a good internal control for a company, it is not a justification for theft. Another common rationalization is that a company is vast and rich while an employee may feel small and poor and taking to from the rich to give to the poor is not bad. Again, there may be some truth to this statement, but it is not a reason justifying theft.</p><p>Companies can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing these fraud factors and taking active steps to reduce them, steps including internal controls. For example, companies should safeguard assets and should create a culture of honesty, communication, and respect, a culture that needs to be demonstrated from the top down. If the culture is bad at the top good employees will not be able to pull up the culture from the bottom.</p><p><strong>Objectivity \u2013 </strong>To provide information useful to investors creditors, and others. The concept of objectivity seems obvious, but we always need to keep the end goal in mind, the creation of useful information for external users. Financial accounting is aimed at producing useful information for external users like investors, creditors, and customers, the format of this information usually being financial statements. By anticipating the needs of external users, we can set rules and guidelines to provide the most value.</p><p><strong>Qualitative Characteristics</strong> \u2013 To require information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable. The characteristics of relevance, reliability, and comparability are related to the objective of providing useful information because external users will value these features.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Relevant</strong> means the information is relevant or necessary to the needs of the users. Relevant information could be information that influences the decision-making process. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements to assess the likelihood of a business\u2019s ability to pay the loan back in the future.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Reliable</strong> means that the information must be trusted or must be believed that it is free of material errors and is presented in a fair way. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements and want assurance that they can be trusted. Part of the assurance requirement may be that the financial statements are presented in a standardized form, following a standardized set of rules. A bank may also ask for a third-party review or audit to add to the level of reliability.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Comparability </strong>means that financial information needs to be comparable to prior periods and other companies. Comparability requires standardization, a systematic way of compiling data from one time to the next. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may want to compare financial</p><p>statement performance with prior years to see if there has been an improvement and to compare financial statements to other businesses in the industry. For comparisons of financial statements to be relevant, there needs to be conformity in presentation.</p><p><strong>Going-concern assumption - </strong>the presumption that the business will continue operating instead of being closed. We assume a business is in business to stay in business, to have an objective of revenue generation and growth. If a business is planning on stopping business or is going bankrupt their behavior is likely to be much different than if they planned on continuing business. A business that is not a going concern, one that plans on stopping operations, needs to disclose this information to the readers of their financial statements so that readers can change their default assumption that the business will remain in business.</p><p><strong>Separate business entity assumption -</strong> means that the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction. Every transaction will have a reason and we need to determine if the reason is business or personal in nature.</p><p>The business objective is revenue generation. A business\u2019s mission statement will define what a business does to generate revenue, but from an accounting standpoint, the objective of revenue generation will help guide business actions and help us categorize transactions as either business or personal.</p><p>Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses.

If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the more specific objective of revenue generation, the transaction is a personal one.</p><p>An example of separating business and personal objectives is the creation of a separate business checking account, a separate account allowing us to track the business revenue and expenditures more quickly, most deposits into the business checking account being revenue and most withdrawals being expenses.</p><p>The difference between a business expense and a personal expense is the objective for the expense. For example, if we went out to dinner the cost of the meal may be business or personal depending on the objective. If we took clients to dinner to pick up new business engagements, the meal would be a business expense and if we took our family out to dinner to have fun and live well it would be a personal expense.</p><p>In a similar way as expenses can be either business or personal, assets can also be either business or personal in nature. For example, if we purchase a building with the intention of making widgets for sale the building would be an asset rather than an expense because it will help generate revenue in the future and has not yet been consumed. On the other hand, if we purchase a building to live in as a home it would be a personal asset, the objective being to live well.</p><p>We can think of many areas where business and personal objectives overlap, areas were categorizing the transaction is difficult. For example, we may take both family and clients to dinner or we may work from our home. As accountants, our job is to differentiate the business and personal portion as much as possible to better measure our performance.</p><p>Our business objectives can be thought of as fitting inside our larger personal objectives, the generation of revenue being part of our larger personal goals of living well.</p><p>As the business grows and achieves the business objective of revenue generation owners can begin taking money and resources out of the business to be used for their larger personal objectives of living well.</p><p>\u201cGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are uniform minimum standards of, and guidelines to, financial accounting and reporting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) are authorized to establish these principles.\u201d (AICPA, n.d.)</p><p>Financial Accounting strives to generate financial information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable because these characteristics create value to users of financial reports, particularly to external users of financial reports.</p><p>Creating and implementing standard guidelines for the processing and reporting of financial statements makes the financial statements more relevant, reliable, and comparable. Standards help to standardize financial reporting, making financial statements comparable across time and to other companies.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has authority to set Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and the SEC has delegated much of the responsibilities of setting GAAP to the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. The SEC is a governmental agency, and the FASB is a private sector group. The system of delegating authority to a private sector group makes sense because the accounting profession, like any profession, has an incentive to self-regulate and has a better understanding of the problems within the profession and how best to address them.</p><p>There are many useful ways to separate and categorize business entities, one being by business form, by type of business structure; another being by a business's relation to inventory, whether the business is selling inventory and whether they produce the inventory they are selling.</p><p>The three broad categories of business structure are a sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.</p><p>A <strong>sole proprietorship</strong> is a business owned by one person and is the most common type of business in the United States. The benefits of a sole proprietorship are that they are easy and inexpensive to form. An individual who starts acting as a business, generating revenue, is a sole proprietor by default unless they create some other type of organizations. The income from a sole proprietor is taxable but will be reported on the individual tax return, on Form 1040 supported by a supplemental Schedule C.</p><p>The disadvantages of a sole proprietor include limited personal liability protection and limited capital generation capability when compared to other types of organizations.</p><p>A <strong>partnership</strong> is similar to a sole proprietor except that the business now has two or more partners. A partnership has the same benefit of easy formation and the same drawbacks of liability exposure and limited capital generation.</p><p>A <strong>corporation</strong> is a separate legal entity. Corporations are less common than the sole proprietorship but generate the largest percentage of total U.S. revenue. The benefits of a corporation include that they provide liability protection through being a separate legal entity, the theory being that the assets of the corporation are liable but personal assets are not, personal assets having more protection when compared to other types of organizations. The disadvantages of a corporation include that they are more costly to form, more complicated to maintain, and can result in double taxation.</p><p>Much more can be said about types of entities, but this will provide a starting point. From an accounting perspective, we will start out with transactions related to a sole proprietorship and then move to a partnership and then a corporation. The reason for starting with the sole proprietorship is that it is a business form that most people can relate to and because many of the transactions found in a sole proprietorship will be the same for all entity types.</p><p>We will then move to a partnership, concentrating on the areas that are different from a sole proprietorship. Many of the transactions and processes will be the same, both entities needing to record the paying of the rent, employees, and utilities, both entities recording revenue. Transactions will differ, however, in the equity section because a partnership will have two or more owners, so the equity section is where we will spend much of our time.</p><p>We will then move to a corporation, concentrating on the areas that are different. Many transactions will remain the same, but the equity section is one area that will differ, the owners now being stockholders.</p><p>Another useful way to categorize businesses is by industry or by whether they use inventory and whether they produce inventory. A service company does not sell inventory, a merchandising business purchases and sells inventory, and a manufacturing business produces inventory to sell.</p><p>A company\u2019s relationship with inventory has a significant impact on many accounting transactions and reporting. We will start out with a service company, using similar logic as we did when starting out with a sole proprietorship. Service companies have many of the same transactions as companies that deal with inventory, but they do not need to track inventory. We will then move to merchandising companies, companies that buy and sell inventory, adding the items that are different, items related to inventory. We will then move to a manufacturing companies, companies that produces inventory, adding things that differ, the tracking of inventory from raw materials to work in process and then to finished goods.</p><p>Generally Accepted Accounting Principle GAAP will be based on accrual concepts. The accrual basis can be compared and contrasted to a cash basis, the cash basis being a simplified method, one which does not provide information as useful, as relevant, or as accurate as an accrual method.</p><p><strong>Cash basis</strong> \u2013 Records revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. A cash basis is not the basis required by GAAP, GAAP rules following an accrual basis, but understanding a cash basis helps in understanding both how an accrual basis works and the reasons for it. Cash and revenue are not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when revenue will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash collection does not always equal the exact location in time of revenue earnings but is often close enough.</p><p>In a similar way as revenue being recorded when cash is received under a cash basis, expenses are recorded when cash is paid under a cash basis. Cash and expenses are also not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when expenses will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash payment does not always equal the exact location in time expenses were incurred but is often close enough.</p><p>Very few businesses use a pure cash basis because there are times when the smoke is not close to the fire, times when revenue is not close to cash collection, and times when expense incursion is not close to cash payment. For example, almost any business would recognize a cash payment of $100,000 for a building as an asset of a building rather than an expense of building expense even though cash is paid. The reason a building is recorded as an asset is that the asset has not yet been consumed, has not yet been used to generate revenue.</p><p><strong>Accrual basis</strong> \u2013 is driven by two main principles, the revenue recognition principle and the matching principle. Revenue recognition deals with the time to recognize revenue and the matching principle deals with the time to record expenses.</p><p>The revenue recognition principle records revenue when the revenue is earned, a time which is not always the same as when revenue is paid. Finding the exact time that revenue has been earned is not always easy but is usually when the job has been completed. For example, the time when revenue has been earned for a service company is when the job has been completed, when the service is done, and the time when revenue has been earned for a merchandising company is when inventory is delivered to the customer. An accrual method is closer to a firefighter using a GPS system to pinpoint the exact location of a fire rather than just estimating the location by following the smoke.</p><p>For example, a food truck may have a policy of only accepting cash for food. The policy of accepting cash as the only form of payment means the time cash is received and the time work is done will be the same. Therefore, both a cash method and an accrual method will result in the same journal entry but for different reasons, the cash method being driven by the cash received, the accrual method being driven by the earnings of the income, by the delivery of the food.</p><p>A bookkeeping business, on the other hand, will often need to perform work, invoice the client on completion of the work, expecting a check in the mail sometime in the future. The revenue recognition principle would require revenue to be recognized at the time the work was done, often when the invoice was generated and not when cash was received. We will cover the format of these transactions a little later but for now, recognize that revenue is the act of earning revenue which is different from receiving cash, cash usually being the form of payment for revenue earned. There are other forms of payment, including trade or barter, but cash is the most common form of payment. The revenue recognition principle is similar to how most of us think of our paychecks when working for a company. A business may pay employees every other week, but an employee has earned the revenue in the week the work was done. The company is expected to pay the employee for work done even if the employee leaves the company. For example, if an employee earned wages of $1,000 last week according to their employment agreement and employment is terminated this week the employee will still expect payment of $1,000 for the work performed last week, for revenue that was earned by the employee last week even though cash had not yet been received.</p><p>It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received. For example, a newspaper company will collect money before doing the work, before delivering newspapers. A newspaper company will often collect money for a year\u2019s subscription and then earn the revenue by delivering the newspapers in the future. Under an accrual method the newspaper company will have to wait on recording revenue until they earn the revenue by doing work, by delivering the papers, even though they already have the cash in hand. Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those </p><p>Click Here</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received.

Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those future sales and if they do not deliver the newspapers in the future they will owe the money back.</p><p>As mentioned earlier there are many ways the double entry accounting system can be expressed including the use of an accounting equation, debits and credits, and a balance sheet. We will focus on the accounting equations in this section. The benefits of an accounting equation include the use of a simple formula, simple math that can be explained and understood. Transactions will be described using the symmetry of the accounting equation. The problem with using the accounting equation to record transactions and build the financial statements is that it is not as efficient as the use of debits and credits. We will learn the balancing concept using the accounting equation, but as we do, keep in mind that the accounting equation is not the whole story, that we will need to understand new concepts, the concepts of debits and credits, to record data with which to generate financial statements well.</p><p>The accounting equation is:</p><p><strong>Asset = Liabilities + Equity</strong></p><p>The format above is the most common form of the accounting equation for financial accounting because the left side of the equation shows what the business owns and the right side shows who it is owed to, either a third-party liability or the owner. Recall our separate business entity assumption while considering the accounting equation. Thinking of the business as a separate entity helps to understand the accounting equation, the left side of the equal sign showing what the separate entity owns, the right showing who has claim to what the separate entity owns.</p><p>Because the accounting equation is a formula it can be expressed at least two other ways. A second way to write the equation is:</p><p><strong>Assets \u2013 Liabilities = Equity</strong></p><p>The format of the accounting equation above is useful because it emphasizes that equity is the book value of the company, the amount left over after subtracting liabilities from assets, an amount which can also be called net assets. To understand the meaning of equity we can consider the liquidation of a company, the selling of assets for cash, the payment of liabilities owed, and the leftover cash which would then be available to the owner, this amount being equal to equity if assets were sold at book value. Note that all assets will not be sold for the exact amount reported when a business is sold. For example, an asset of equipment valued at $50,000 may not be sold for $50,000 in a free market, possibly being sold for something less like $40,000 or something more like $60,000. We will discuss this more at a later time. For now, remember that equity represents net assets on a book value basis, assets minus liabilities. </p><p>A third way to write the accounting equation is:</p><p><strong>Assets \u2013 Equity = Liabilities</strong></p><p>This format of the accounting equation is not as useful but is another way the accounting equation can be expressed algebraically.</p><p>Account types include assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. Recognize that account types are not the same thing as actual accounts, each account type having multiple accounts falling into the category. Understanding account types and the accounts that fall into each account type category is essential to the accounting process.</p><p><strong>Assets</strong> are resources owned by the business. The most common asset is cash, but assets also include accounts receivable, prepayments, land, building, and equipment. Assets are items that have not yet been consumed, resources planned to be used in the future to achieve business goals, to help generate revenue.</p><p><strong>Liabilities</strong> are claims by creditors. Liabilities come about from a transaction that happens in the past which obligates the company for some form of future payment. Purchasing something on a credit card is an example of how a liability can be created, the transaction creating a future obligation to pay cash. Liability accounts include accounts payable, notes payable, and bonds payable.</p><p><strong>Equity</strong> is the owner\u2019s claim to assets. Equity is equal to assets minus liabilities. Equity is often the most confusing section of the accounting equation, in part, because different organization types will organize the equity section differently and because the equity section is involved in the closing process of temporary accounts.</p><p>The equity section represents what is owed to the owner on a book basis. This is best illustrated by imagining we liquidate or close a business, selling the assets for cash, and then paying off the liabilities. The money left over would be equal to the equity section if all sales were made on a book value basis.</p><p>The equity section for a sole proprietor will be called owner\u2019s equity and consist of one capital account. The equity section of a partnership will be called partnership equity and consist of two or more owners and therefore two or more capital accounts. The equity section of a corporation will be called shareholder\u2019s equity, shareholders being the owners of a corporation, and will included capital stock and retained earnings. Although the format changes the equity section taken as a whole can still be thought of as what is owed to the owner or owners in each case.</p><p>When thinking about the accounting equation, the equity section includes all temporary accounts, including revenue accounts and expense accounts.</p><p><strong>Revenue - </strong>is income generated from performing work. Revenue is not the same thing as cash. Cash is a form of payment while revenue represents the creation of value and the earning of compensation. Revenue is a timing account, needing to be measured over a time frame, a starting and ending point. For example, when somebody says they earn $100,000 the concept has no meaning unless we assign a time frame, most people naturally attributing a year as the time frame when hearing a number like $100,000. A different time frame would have a much different meaning. For example, revenue of $100,000 a month is much different than revenue of $100,000 a year.</p><p>We can contrast temporary accounts, like revenue and expense accounts, with permanent accounts like cash. Saying we have $100,000 cash does not require a time frame to define what we mean because cash is a permanent account, representing a position at a point in time.</p><p><strong>Expense</strong> is the using of assets or incurrence of liabilities as part of operations to generate revenue. Expenses are what a business needs to consume to achieve the goal of revenue generation. Expenses are also temporary accounts needing a beginning and ending time.</p><p>There are usually many more expense accounts then revenue accounts, but we hope the revenue accounts add up to a greater dollar amount. The reason there are more expense accounts then revenue accounts is because of specialization, companies focusing on earning money by doing what they do best and paying for their other needs.</p><p>Before we demonstrate common transactions and how they are analyzed using the accounting equating we will cover transaction rules. Applying a process for recording transactions will reduce the likelihood of making bad assumptions and learning rules that do not apply in all cases.</p><p>It is possible to learn rules that apply in only some cases, requiring the unlearning of these rules when we move to cases where they do not apply. Learning rules that do not apply in all cases should be avoided because unlearning rules in cases where a bad rule does not apply is tough.</p><p>Learning and applying the steps below for recording transactions helps avoid problems, eliminating the need to unlearn false concepts in the future. These same rules will apply when we move to learning debits and credits at which time we will build on these rules, applying more concepts to the balancing ideas developed here.</p><p><strong>Transaction Rules:</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Every transaction will affect at least two accounts.</p><p>\u00b7 Every transaction will keep the accounting equation in balance.</p><p>Transaction thought process</p><p>When first learning transactions we will repeat this thought process for each transaction, the thought process being designed to make the recording of transactions as easy as possible, and avoid learning rules that are not always applicable. This process will make more sense as we work through transactions. Working transactions is the only way to understand the double entry accounting system fully.</p><p>We will now go through common financial transactions, transactions needed by most any business, and analyze them using the accounting equation and our set of rules and thought processes.</p><p>We will start off looking at transactions involving cash, cash being the most common account affected. Understanding how cash is affected will act like an add, or crutch, when considering the other account or accounts effected in the transaction.</p><p>First, imagine a situation where the cash goes up because the company received cash, and consider possibilities for the other account affected.</p><p>We know that at least one other account will be effect and that the accounting equation must remain in balance. If there is only one other account effected we are left with just three possibilities to keep the accounting equation in balance. Either the liabilities went up, equity went up, or another asset account also went down. Below are examples of each.</p><p>If cash went up because of a business receiving a bank loan, then liabilities would also go up, keeping the accounting equation in balance.</p><p>If cash went goes up do to collecting cash for work the company did then revenue or income would also go up, revenue being part of equity.</p><p>If cash went up because we are receiving money for work done in the past we would also reduce the accounts receivable account, an asset account representing money owed to the company for past work completed.</p><p>It is possible to use an expanded accounting equation, listing all accounts under each account type, forming a kind of trial balance which can be used to create the financial statements. We will not be using this format here because it is not an efficient way to generate financial statements and gives the impression that debits and credits are not needed, which is not a good impression to give.</p><p>To understand double entry accounting and how financial statements are created, the accounting equation is not sufficient, and debits and credit will be needed. We will introduce how debits and credits work later, but the concepts will build on the concepts we learn here working with the accounting equation.</p><p>Below are more common transaction and the effect on the accounting equation:</p><p><strong>Owner invests cash into the business:</strong></p><p>The asset account of cash goes up as well as equity, the amount owed to the owner. Equity goes up because the business basically owes the cash back to the owner. When investing cash into a business, an owner is hoping to receive a return on investment and be able to withdraw cash from the business in the future, to be used for personal use.</p><p><strong>Purchase of supplies for cash:</strong></p><p>The asset of cash goes down, but another asset of supplies goes up, the net result being no change in any account type of the account equation. The result of a transaction with no change to the accounting equation is one reason debits and credits are a more efficient way to record transactions then the use of the accounting equation. We will record much the same transaction using debits and credits later.</p><p>The increase in supplies is an increase in an asset type account rather than an expense type account, expenses being part of equity, because of the accrual accounting principle of matching. When the supplies are purchased, they have not yet been used to help generate revenue but will help to generate revenue in the future. Supplies will be expensed in the time they are used or consumed to help generate revenue.</p><p>Supplies will be our introduction to an inventory system because supplies will be tracked in a similar way as inventory. The recording of supplies will start with reporting supplies as an asset, followed by the counting of supplies at end of a time period, like a month, to determine how much has been used, and then the recording of the decrease is the supplies asset account and recording of the supplies utilized in the supplies expense account.</p><p>Supplies may be expenses when purchased if the amount is not material, not significant to decision making, because expensing the supplies is an easier process than capitalizing as an asset when the amount is not significant to decision making. For example, if we purchased two years\u2019 worth of paper-clips for $100 we may just expense the purchase because the cost of $100 is not significant to decision making, $100 not being an amount that will impact financial statement user choices.</p><p><strong>Purchase Supplies on Account \u2013 No Cash:</strong></p><p>Because no cash is effected, we will first consider what is received, that being supplies in this case. The asset account of supplies will go up, and the liability account of accounts payable will go up. The accounts payable account is like a credit card account, going up when we purchase on account and going down when we pay off the balance owed.</p><p><strong>Pay Cash for Telephone Service:</strong></p><p>The asset account of cash will go down and the expense account of telephone expense will go up, bringing equity down. Expense accounts can be confusing when considering the effect on the accounting equation because expense accounts are temporary accounts and are part of the equity section of the accounting equation. Expenses represent the consumption of assets or the incursion of liabilities to help generate revenue. Assets consumed or liabilities incurred to help generate revenue will bring down equity, equity calculated as assets minus liabilities.</p><p><strong>Completed Work on Account \u2013 No cash received:</strong></p><p>If no cash is effected, we will consider what was received, that being an \u201cI owe you\u201d from a customer in this case. An asset of an \u201cI owe you\u201d from a customer seems strange at first, a promised payment not being tangible, but a promise to pay does have value even though there is a chance it will not ever be received. Accounts receivable is the account representing an \u201cI owe you\u201d from customers, an asset account showing value due for work done.</p><p>The asset of accounts receivable will go up, and revenue or income will go up, increasing the equity section of the accounting equation. Revenue is a temporary account representing income that has been earned, and temporary accounts are part of the equity section.</p><p><strong>Payment for Amount Owed for Past Transaction:</strong></p><p>Cash will go down, and liabilities will go down. Paying cash for a transaction that happened in the past, for value received in the past, means we are paying off a liability, like paying off a credit card. Accounts payable is the most common liability account for most companies, representing what is owed to third-party vendors. When we pay off a balance that is due the liability account of accounts payable will go down.</p><p>Financial statements are the end goal of financial accounting, the final product most useful to external users like investors, creditors, and customers. Financial statements include the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of equity, and the statement of cash flows. We will concentrate on the first three statements here and move to the statement of cash flows later.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4268574", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "American Petroleum Institute API PRACTICE QUESTIONS", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "11", "students": "5304", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4268574_a0d3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/american-petroleum-institute-api-practice-questions/?couponCode=60B52484C962E1D00F99", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:06:00+00:00", "headline": "American Petroleum Institute API PRACTICE QUESTIONS API 570  API 571", "description": "<p>The <strong>American Petroleum Institute</strong> (<strong>API</strong>) is the largest U.S. trade association for the oil and natural gas industry.

It grants citizenship for all those who will pass the exam and was meant to facilitate immigrants and refugees to settle permanently in Canada.</p><p><strong>The Cost of a Wonderful Living</strong></p><p>Now what are the requirements that you need to submit and present to obtain a Canadian citizenship?</p><ul><li><p>People aged over 18yrs. Old are eligible to take the exam</p></li><li><p>Must be able to speak and write any of Canada\u2019s official languages (English and French)</p></li><li><p>Have been settling in Canada for 3 years out of the last 5 years before the day of application.</p></li><li><p>Have filed all taxes for at least 3 years during the last 5 years, note that all income taxes that you owe must be fully paid.</p></li></ul><p>Canadian Citizenship can only be obtained through a legal permanent residency in Canada or through the following.</p><p><strong>If the person is under 18 years of age,</strong> the guardian or the parent of the applicant will have to apply on behalf of them for a citizenship.</p><p><strong>If the person is over 18 years of age and have children,</strong> he/she can include application with your own.</p><p>Fast track citizenship application process is given to any member of the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces.</strong></p><p>Upon the day of the test, the applicant must present a letter of consent from the government informing the authorities on the actual day of your test, followed by an informal interview that can take up to 30 minutes and you will be asked to provide all the necessary documents for the citizenship test.</p><p>Each applicant must bring the following,</p><ul><li><p>Record of Landing (IMM 1000) or <em>Confirmation of Permanent Residence</em> (IMM 5292)</p></li><li><p>Permanent Resident Card (PRC).</p></li><li><p>One identity document which includes the applicant\u2019s photograph with signature.</p></li><li><p>Passports and all travel documents that the applicant possess.</p></li><li><p>Original copies of all supporting documents such as <em>Birth Certificate, Marriage Contract etc.</em></p></li></ul><p>After submitting the requirements, it will now be verified through the following information,</p><ul><li><p>Signature of the applicant on the notice form is necessary.</p></li><li><p>The signature provided in the notice form will be verified by comparing it to the signatures in the applicant\u2019s supporting documents.</p></li><li><p>Photos provided along with the supporting documents will be verified against the person in front of the official. This is the reason why your actual presence is really important.</p></li></ul><p>Take note, that applicants who fail to prove their identity will not be allowed to take the actual test. Citizenship officers will then check the original copies and will coordinate the authenticity of these documents to the corresponding consular offices.</p><p>Only those who completed the requirements will continue to take the exam, only certified copies or original copies of documents can be accepted as proof of application unless the applicant is currently applying for a replacement of certificate.</p><p>Now that the requirements are ready, time to schedule and pass the Canadian Citizenship Exam.</p><p><strong>The Test of Fate</strong></p><p>The test is based on a study guide by the government to determine the applicant\u2019s knowledge in Canadian history, geography, culture and politics.</p><p>The citizenship exam lasts for 30 minutes with 20 multiple questions, applicants who are taking up the exam must answer at least 15 correct questions out of 20 to pass the exam.</p><p>Passing rate for the last 5 years is more than 60%, but rest assured that this test is not as easy as your history lessons. The exam is totally different, imagine for instance, an immigrant who have been a Filipino citizen for his entire life might face the most difficult written exam in his entire life. For the test focuses on a wide range of subject matters such as:</p><ul><li><p>Rights and Responsibilities of a Canadian Citizen</p></li><li><p>Canadian History</p></li><li><p>Canadian Political Systems</p></li><li><p>Canadian Physical and Political Geography</p></li></ul><p>Canadian roots and population will also be portrayed in the exam and the applicant must have an idea on how they value democracy, gender equality and human rights.</p><p>The exam is usually written, however in some cases, this test might be done in oral depending on the situation. The test is divided into different stages, from the history of the native people who first lived in Canada, the language that they use, their culture and the early form of their civilization. The first segment of the exam focuses more on the history of the first people in Canada and the language that they use although out the colonial period.</p><p>Taking up the exam means to study the entire history, demographics and geography of Canada. After finishing the first segment of the exam, it will be followed by a test on Modern Day Canada, Economy and Symbolism. This test shows you the actual scenario of what it means to become a real Canadian Citizen and embracing the history and rich culture of Canada.</p><p><strong>By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.</strong></p><p>There different institutions and online practices that you can find to sharpen your deep knowledge about the Canadian history, culture, roots and politics. Prepare yourself and begin to ready your history books and take up online courses for the exam only allows you have 5 wrong answer, answer all the questions and if you do not know the answer, a 25% chance of guessing the right answer might help you out. Read much and study harder before the exam but make sure not to put too much pressure on it. Get some rest and a decent sleep before the day of examination. Relax, read and understand the questions.</p><p><strong>After Passing the Exam</strong></p><p>If the applicant met the requirements of having a minimum of 15 correct answers and when the official has done verifying the authenticity of the applicant\u2019s documents. He/she will be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony within 4-6 months or might receive another questionnaire requesting more evidence of living in Canada.</p><p>After passing the exam, the citizenship authorities will provide the exact date and time of the citizenship ceremony, in the ceremony, the applicant will begin to take an Oath of Citizenship announcing that he is now legally and officially a Canadian citizen. After the Oathtaking, the applicant\u2019s citizenship certificate will be given.</p><p>Try not to worry more about the residency questionnaire, for it will only ask the applicant to provide more evidence of his living in Canada. Usually this is given to those who have traveled a lot outside Canada or those who have complexity in the application. Once the applicant receives this residency questionnaire, he will be invited for an interview once again with the citizenship officer and might ask for more supportive documents.</p><p><strong>A hope for those who failed the Citizenship Test</strong></p><p>If the applicant failed to pass exam but meet all the requirements to become a Canadian citizen, the Citizenship Officer will recommend the applicant to retake the exam or reschedule a second test. This could happen within 4-8 weeks after the commencement of the first one. The applicant must confirm his attendance for the second exam to the authorities immediately. During the second exam, the applicant will also receive the results on the same day. If the applicant, once again failed the exam he will be invited by a citizenship judge for an interview that usually takes 30-90 minutes. You will be asked a lot of questions orally on why you need to become a Canadian citizen. The judge would want to know the motives of your application and might ask the legitimacy of the time that you spent living in Canada. This interview will also test your English or French language skills as well as your knowledge about Canada.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4473594", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Become A Certified JS Developer: JavaScript Practice Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Pawan Saini", "duration": "0", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "74", "students": "9437", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4473594_aa28.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-certified-js-developer-javascript-practice-tests/?couponCode=7F3BE93DDF5A5F52B48D", "end_day": "2022-04-29 02:02:00+00:00", "headline": "Complete the JavaScript Certification Test today!", "description": "<p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p><strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong>, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead of in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company. When you can do both, you can do things that no one else can do and you will be a unique asset to your company.</p><p>There\u2019s a shift underway in large organizations, one that puts design much closer to the center of the enterprise. But the shift isn\u2019t about aesthetics. It\u2019s about applying the principles of design for a better user experience. This new approach is in large part a response to the increasing complexity of modern technology and modern business.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Most people don't think about how poorly designed everyday interactions are until they learn the principles of good design and user experience, many of which are not intuitive. You don't need to be born thinking about this stuff in order to become a successful designer, it's a skill that can be developed like anything else. Passion often follows knowledge and expertise.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In this course, I have explained the entire design process which when integrated into your product can create an amazing user experience. You will also learn to approach a problem in a systematic manner. Working in a series is the most important stage of the design process. The ability to experiment, value and learn from mistakes, and build on the experience achieved is the hallmark of the truly successful and creative individual, whatever the field.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So, what are you waiting for??

Using sample questions to study for your test is the most effective study practice you can use. The advantages of using RMA sample tests include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increasing Your Speed</strong> \u2013 The RMA exam has a three hour time limit. Although most students who take the RMA feel that there is sufficient time, taking the practice tests with self-imposed timers help you budget your time effectively. You should budget approximately 1 minute for each question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Becoming comfortable with the Test Format</strong> \u2013 Every standardized test has its own unique format. As you take practice RMA tests you will become comfortable with the format of the actual test. Once the test day arrives you will have no surprises!</p></li><li><p><strong>Concentrating Your Prep Time</strong> \u2013 As you take more and more sample quizzes you begin to get a feel for the topics that you know well and the areas that you are weak on. Many students waste a lot of valuable study time by reviewing material that they are good at (often because it is easier or makes them feel better). The most effective way to study is to concentrate on the areas that you need help on.</p></li></ul><p>RMA EXAM OVERVIEW</p><p>The RMA certification exam consists of 200-210 questions that count towards your score.

The test has just been updated for February 2021. This is the first test in a series that covers the knowledge and skills of basic nursing you\u2019ll need as a new certified nursing assistant (CNA). The questions are based on the same categories that are included in the official exam. The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint. If you still make a mistake, you\u2019ll see the correct response displayed along with an explanation to help you understand. If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator. The skills test portion is about 35-45 minutes and covers five or more skills.</p><p><strong>Alternate names:</strong></p><p>A CNA test is also known as:</p><ul><li><p>Certified Nursing Assistant examination</p></li><li><p>Nursing assistant test</p></li><li><p>CNA knowledge test</p></li><li><p>CNA exam</p></li><li><p>Nurse assistant test</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why CNAs are important</strong></p><p>Certified Nursing Assistants are vital members of the health care team.

We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>The course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 QuickBooks Backup files</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Excel practice files</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Downloadable PDF Files\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Who will we be learning from?\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who is a:\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Master of Science in Taxation\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Curriculum Development Export\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>As a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>As a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

Assistant questions that will help you prepare for your exam. The test has just been updated for February 2021. This is the first test in a series that covers the knowledge and skills of basic nursing you\u2019ll need as a new certified nursing assistant (CNA). The questions are based on the same categories that are included in the official exam. The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint. If you still make a mistake, you\u2019ll see the correct response displayed along with an explanation to help you understand. If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator. The skills test portion is about 35-45 minutes and covers five or more skills.</p><p><strong>Alternate names:</strong></p><p>A CNA test is also known as:</p><ul><li><p>Certified Nursing Assistant examination</p></li><li><p>Nursing assistant test</p></li><li><p>CNA knowledge test</p></li><li><p>CNA exam</p></li><li><p>Nurse assistant test</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why CNAs are important</strong></p><p>Certified Nursing Assistants are vital members of the health care team.

We will also discuss some problem areas many businesses have and how to set up a system that works for them.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will work through a practice problem and will provide test data that learners can use in their system to follow along if they choose.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "972262", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Video & Mobile Marketing", "title": "Viral YouTube Marketing - Crash Course + Live Class", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "138", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "1226", "students": "123826", "coupon_code": "17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/972262_d236_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/viralnomics-creating-youtube-video-ideas-that-go-viral/?couponCode=17AD591C545AC79BD0C1", "end_day": "2022-04-25 05:13:00+00:00", "headline": "The Ultimate Viral YouTube Marketing Course to learn and master in 2022.", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience</em><strong> \"Viral YouTube Marketing - Crash Course (2022 Grand Edition)\".</strong></p><p><strong><em>Did you know? </em></strong></p><p>Millions of videos are uploaded to YouTube on a daily basis.
