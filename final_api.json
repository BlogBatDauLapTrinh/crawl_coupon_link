It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.</p><p>&nbsp; It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula 150 millions people speak Arabic&nbsp; to learn its vocabularies you should listen to Arabic speakers in every field listen before speak the Arabic grammar&nbsp; &nbsp;is very important to know the structure of the sentence s </p><p>how can I speak like native&nbsp; listen to drama listen to old songs listen to sport listen to cartoon video clips&nbsp; &nbsp;all in Arabic try to repeat the words and phrases</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4455070", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_category": "Mental Health", "title": "CBT: Complete psychotherapy Certificate Course", "level": "All Levels", "author": "BS Academy", "duration": "272", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "26", "students": "9132", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4455070_baa7_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/cbt-psychotherapy-certificate-diploma-course/?couponCode=8583E6AF2F57F8C05833", "end_day": "2022-06-07 12:19:00+00:00", "headline": "CBT is an intensive, short-term,  problem-oriented approach, psychotherapy, depression, anxiety, stress, certification", "description": "<p>CBT is an intensive, short-term,&nbsp; problem-oriented approach.

In this course you will learn how to create so-called \u201cbone-based\u201d 2D characters - characters that are made out of separate body parts. The material in this course is divided into 3 Sections. Section 1 features a short introduction to the course.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 2 we will focus on making a simple bone-based character from scratch. We`ll go through the whole process of character creation from setting up an empty Unity project and importing sprite sheets with art to assembling a bone-based character the right way and animating it using Unity`s built-in mechanim animation system. By the end of this Section we`ll have a simple bone-based character that can walk and jump on our improvised level.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Section 3 we will talk about some advanced techniques of working with 2D animated characters. For bone-based characters correct sorting order in the scene is very important, so in our first couple of lectures we`ll talk about resolving all the sorting order issues. Then we`ll discuss how to apply different looks and different clothing items to your character. This approach is very convenient, because you can have all the characters in your game made from a single character prefab, but they can all use different outfits and look differently. It`s also much easier to dress your characters or re-skin your game if you need.

It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>Journalism</strong> course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future media presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your media presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your media presentation skills are not up to high standards.

Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you. What's more?&nbsp;This course will also contain the Google Ads dashboard walkthrough taught by Srinidhi and video advertising campaign creation steps along with the report-seeking process.</p><p>It's time to become a Professional YouTube Advertising Expert in the fastest time possible ever!</p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p><p>Enroll now and let's start the magic.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2779054", "category": "Design", "sub_category": "Design Tools", "title": "Video Editing with Avid Media Composer First for Beginners", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "AK Media", "duration": "34", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "191", "students": "60146", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2779054_32e6_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-avid-media-composer-first-for-beginners/?couponCode=A45DABCE3BDA0804CBC2", "end_day": "2022-06-03 03:53:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn the critical fundamentals of video editing with Avid Media Composer.", "description": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>A licensed copy of Avid Media Composer First ( Free to download )</p></li></ul><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>Avid Media Composer is widely used video production software in Film and TV industry. </p><p><strong>This training class provides the critical fundamentals of video editing with Avid Media Composer for beginners.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this course we have covered the basics of editing with Avid where you get a detailed look at the workings of the interface and learn how to do Basic Edits and apply Transitions.</p><p>There are some additional videos that I will continue to upload to explain the interface change(s).

The breeding of chickens in captivity dates back to at least 1400 BC in Egypt. But intensive poultry production only&nbsp; before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, built about 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs,&nbsp; arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs IN ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods, and meals often started with an egg course The dried egg industry developed in the 19th century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.&nbsp; &nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese.

These and other cognitive functions are performed by the vastly interconnected neural networks formed by the roughly 100 billion neurons of the brain. The precise patterns of connectivity among neurons within these networks determines their function, and through experience, these connectivity patterns change over time to enable acquisition of new skills. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of brain function is the ability to learn new cognitive skills, such as the ability to understand and speak a foreign language. During learning, connections between neurons change through a process known as synaptic plasticity, which plays a pivotal role in learning, While traditional learning brings about changes in neural networks through experience, synaptic plasticity can also be enhanced by activating neuromodulatory regions in the brain via peripheral neurostimulation. This program seeks to use peripheral neurostimulation to facilitate the release of neurotransmitters associated with components of learning, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, we can leverage endogenous neuronal circuitry to enhance learning by accelerating the tuning of neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.</p><p>Recent success with this approach has been demonstrated in clinical rehabilitation studies, utilizing peripheral neurostimulation delivered through implanted electrodes. However, while invasive approaches may be justified for treating people with medical conditions, noninvasive methods are preferred for use in healthy individuals</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "496180", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Affiliate Marketing", "title": "The Importance of JV Contests in Exploding Your Business", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nikhil  Kapoor", "duration": "89", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "17", "students": "6833", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/496180_2d1d_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/jv-leaderboard/?couponCode=JUNE01", "end_day": "2022-06-07 16:49:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn how you can win 98%+ of the JV contests with big and expensive prizes as a beginner", "description": "<p><strong><em>LATEST UPDATE: October, 2015</em></strong></p><p><strong>CONSISTENTLY WIN JV CONTESTS PRIZES LIKE CASH, CARS AND HOLIDAYS\u2026 EXPLODE YOUR LIST AND PROFITS, USING THESE UNIQUE STRATEGIES THAT YOU CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE\u2026 I GUARANTEE!!! </strong></p><p><strong><em>Your list will soon grow with hundreds and thousands of subscribers\u2026 You're going to get the fantastic opportunity to join JV contests that go on practically every single day\u2026 and WIN THE TOP PRIZES!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Why should you join JV contests?</strong> - Because The Benefits Are ENERMOUS</p><p>For starters, you will explode your list with more subscribers and profits, because JV contests are motivating and above all, FUN!

It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is through the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.

Java\u2019s Popularity and High Salary:</strong><br>Java is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some <strong>9 million developers</strong> and it <strong>runs on around 7 billion devices worldwide</strong> according to Oracle blogs. Because of the high demand for Java, Java developers are also quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry. The average salary of a Java Developer lies between <strong>$47,169 to $106,610 per year</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Java is Easy to Learn:</strong><br>Java is quite easy to learn and can be understood in a short span of time as it has a syntax similar to English. You can also learn from <strong>GeeksforGeeks Java Tutorials</strong>. This will guide you on how to get started with Java and make yourself proficient in it.</p><p><strong>3. Java has a Large Community:</strong><br>There is a large online community of Java users ranging from beginner, advanced, and even expert levels that are particularly helpful in case any support is required. Some of the online communities for learning purposes are <strong>StackOverflow</strong>, <strong>Java Forums</strong>, etc. Also, there is a lot of resources like <strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong> etc. available on the internet regarding Java.</p><p><strong>4. Java has an abundant API:</strong><br>Java has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing their inside implementations.</p><p>Java has mainly three types of API i.e. <strong>Official Java core API\u2019s, Optional official Java API\u2019s and Unofficial API\u2019s.</strong> These API\u2019s overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.</p><p><strong>5. Java has multiple Open Source Libraries:</strong><br>Open-source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open-source libraries in Java such as <strong><em>JHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons</em></strong>, etc. that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.</p><p><strong>6. Java has Powerful Development Tools:</strong><br>There are many Integrated development environments (IDE\u2019s) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. Powerful Java IDE\u2019s such as <strong>Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.</strong> play a big role in the success of Java.<br>These IDE\u2019s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.<br>Java has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around <strong>90% of fortune 500 companies</strong> to developing a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.</p><p><strong>7. Java is Free of Cost:</strong><br>One of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL) free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is required.</p><p><strong>8. Java is Platform Independent:</strong><br>Java is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.</p><p>Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.</p><p><strong>9. Java has great Documentation Support:</strong><br>The documentation support for Java is excellent using <strong>Javadoc</strong> which is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc provides a great reference while coding in Java so that understanding the code is quite simple.</p><p><strong>10. Java is Versatile:</strong><br>Java is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms.

This is starting to happen with Android app development. Developers who used to use Java are switching to Kotlin. You can see why Google want this to happen. They have been in court numerous times with Oracle (the owners of Java) relating to a dispute over the use of the Java language.</p><p>Google want developers to adopt Kotlin so that they don't have to worry about Java any more.</p><p>The recent Google I/O conference show mainly Kotlin code examples. You can see where we are heading.

One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome. Hence, it provides the most information about very small differences between two viruses that would look the same using other diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>Viral replication</strong> is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.&nbsp; Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.</p><p>Through the generation of abundant copies of its genome and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts. Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells.

The virus attaches to the cell membrane of the host cell.

The virus takes advantage of the existing cell structures to replicate itself</p><p><strong>synthesis of virus components</strong>[</p><p>The components are manufactured by the virus using the host's existing organelles:</p><p>\u2022Viral proteins: Viral mRNA is translated on cellular ribosomes into two types of viral protein:</p><p>\u2022Structural: proteins which make up the virus particle</p><p>\u2022Nonstructural: proteins not found in the virus particle, mainly enzymes for virus genome replication </p><p>Viral nucleic acid (genome replication): New viral genomes are synthesized; templates are either the parental genome or newly formed complementary strands, in the case of single-stranded genomes. These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using integrase. Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases </p><p><strong>class 7: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate </strong>This small group of viruses, exemplified by the Hepatitis B virus, have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle&nbsp; (ccc DNA) that serves as a template for production of viral mRNAs and a sub genomic RNA. The progenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase and for production of the DNA genome.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1905626", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Transformation", "title": "Control Your Subconscious Mind: Neuroscience Hidden Secrets", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Dr. Vijender Goel", "duration": "145", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "235", "students": "35228", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1905626_c5c0_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/master-your-brain-to-achieve-your-desired-success/?couponCode=JUN2022FREE1", "end_day": "2022-06-07 15:16:00+00:00", "headline": "The ULTIMATE Neuroscience Blueprint to UNLOCK and UTILIZE your subconscious mind.

Section 1 features a short introduction to the course.\u00a0 \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 2 we will focus on making cards. We will use Unity UI features to create both faces and card backs of our cards. Spell cards and creature cards will be designed a bit differently. Creature cards will have distinctive oval frames around creature images. You will learn how to rotate cards that are made with Unity UI properly. We will do some scripting to make a simple system that will allow us to create and edit our cards as assets in Unity. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 3 we will continue working on different visual elements: mana pools, rope timer, hero portraits, end turn button and so on. By the end of this Section we will assemble a visual layout of our Battle Scene that our players will see in the final version of the game. We will also explore several scripts that will help us drag cards in the game, organize and display enlarged previews of cards and creatures.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In Section 4 we will prepare our project for bringing in all the scripts that will handle Logic in our game. We`ll start by taking a look at a small slideshow that will explain the relationship between Visual and Logical parts of our game. We`ll add several new Visual features \u2013 Damage Effects that will display amounts of damage taken by creatures or heroes in the game, a simple system that will show messages in the start of each turn and targeted dragging for spell cards and creature attacks.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Section 5 is the most complicated Section of this course in terms of scripting. We`ll bring all the remaining scripts, including all the Logic scripts into our project. Our goal for this Section is to establish the most basic game mechanics of drawing cards from deck, playing creatures onto the battlefield and attacking either our opponent`s hero or his creatures. We will also discuss turn management and test our burning rope timer.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In the final section of this course you will learn to create spell and creature effects for your game. Creature effects might be caused when the creature enters the battlefield, when the creature dies, when the turn starts or ends or even when certain events occur in the game (like: when your Hero takes damage, draws a card, etc\u2026). We will also take a look at a simple AI script that will control our opponent`s behavior and let us play this game against the computer.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to save the project that I was working in as often as I can so that you can easily pick up the material from any point in this course. All these assets that are used to create cards, creatures, hero powers and other game elements are free for commercial use and available for download with this course. You can find detailed info on art and scripting assets and links to some other useful resources in the Credits file that you can download with this course.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3657334", "category": "Design", "sub_category": "Graphic Design & Illustration", "title": "Adobe InDesign 2022 Ultimate Course", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Learn Tech Plus", "duration": "191", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "346", "students": "84545", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3657334_75a1_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/adobe-indesign-cc-2020-master-course-q/?couponCode=TRY100052203", "end_day": "2022-06-05 09:50:00+00:00", "headline": "Go from Beginner to Advanced with Adobe InDesign 2022", "description": "<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to Design but don't know where to start?</p><p>Would you like to make amazing Designs and bring your ideas to life?</p><p>Then Adobe InDesign 2022 Ultimate Course is for you!</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m your instructor Josh Werner and I\u2019ll be leading you through this course.</p><p>Design is an in-demand skill in 2022. </p><p>The course begins with the basics.&nbsp; </p><p>I'll take you through everything you need to know to start building designs like an expert with Adobe InDesign 2022.</p><p>You'll learn all the fundamentals of Adobe InDesign 2022. </p><p>This is great for students starting or for Designers that need a refresher course on Adobe InDesign 2022.</p><p>There are no requirements necessary to enroll I only ask that you come open minded and ready to learn</p><p>Feel Free to look through the course description and checkout some of my preview videos</p><p>The course is packed with over 3 hours of hands-on tutorials</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here is what you will Learn:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>01.

They may have started a business or helped companies grow their business or they were senior managers in businesses. They understand some of the challenges business owners face.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course in Tamil will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Tamil"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2306096", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Programa\u00e7\u00e3o em Linguagem C para Iniciantes", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Marco Aur\u00e9lio Thompson", "duration": "197", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "123", "students": "3024", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2306096_872d.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-programacao-em-linguagem-c-para-iniciantes/?couponCode=REALDISCOUNT5E", "end_day": "2022-06-05 09:01:00+00:00", "headline": "Aprenda programa\u00e7\u00e3o em C de forma f\u00e1cil e r\u00e1pida.

Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \"supported for critical security issues only.\" Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beginner Friendliness</strong></p><p><strong>Easy to Get Started With</strong></p><p>PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don't understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.</p><p>The latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.</p><p><strong>Flexible</strong></p><p>PHP is a dynamically typed language. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, PHP is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Arabic"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "410738", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "Certified Network Marketer (Network Marketing & MLM Mastery)", "level": "All Levels", "author": "IDSEI International Direct Selling Educational Institute", "duration": "225", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "751", "students": "28115", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/410738_92a4_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/multi-level-network-marketing-by-professional-instructors/?couponCode=JUNE01", "end_day": "2022-06-07 16:49:00+00:00", "headline": "Master direct selling (network marketing , MLM) and unleash your potential for success in business and in life.", "description": "<p><strong>BEST SELLER COURSE&nbsp; <br> - Update: </strong>2018.12.21 - <em>English Closed-Captions Have Been Added To All Lectures!</em></p><p><strong><em>Student Review:</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50&nbsp; 5 Star rating- July 2018</em></strong></p><p><em>Yes, it's excellent\u2026 Very good overview of - and training in - the DIRECT SELLING industry.</em></p><p><em>Having been in this industry for over 32 years (part time, in addition to my Business &amp; Financial Consulting practice) - and having had the privilege of serving on the Board Of Directors of the industry's professional association for 4 years, representing Canada (ANMP[dot]com - the Association of Network Marketing Professionals) - I see this eCourse from IDSEI, and the accompanying CNM designation, as an important step - both in preparing Affiliates for their business success - and in raising the bar within the industry.</em></p><p><em>Sincerely,</em></p><p><em>Peter Arnold, CLU, CFC / Canada</em></p><p><em>________</em>__________________________________________________________</p><p>Network marketing is one of the world\u2019s most unique and profitable, yet misunderstood business models today.&nbsp;The beauty of network marketing is that anyone gets the chance to start without any experience, knowledge or education.

IDSEI has developed the first professional certification program called: Certified Network Marketer (CNM), with the passion to empower network marketers and direct sellers, by giving them the knowledge and self-confidence they need to succeed.

Perhaps you don't feel really ready to leave your baby with strangers- or even with family. Perhaps you are worried about where you will find the energy to work full - or part - time... or how you will ever manage to get up in time for your commuter train if you have been up most of the night with your baby. Perhaps you are questioning how you will both survive on just a few hours together a day, when you are so used to uninterrupted days and nights together.</p><p><br></p><p>If you find any time to really consider your work, you may be contemplating how you'll manage to pick up your career where you left off - when you can hardly remember where you left the house keys.

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4451966", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Kanban Metrics for Agile teams: Measure & Improve Flow", "level": "All Levels", "author": "GenMan Solutions", "duration": "75", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "46", "students": "12257", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4451966_e631_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/kanban-flow-metrics/?couponCode=E57C5EDBF4BDA8FAC273", "end_day": "2022-06-05 18:02:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Kanban Flow Metrics & Improve Business Agility.

If you're willing to learn and apply the knowledge I share with you,<em> I</em> can teach you the rest.</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm Interested, So What Will I Learn Exactly?</strong></p><p>First, you\u2019ll get a comprehensive, high quality video overview that will show you how to create facebook ads that deliver real results. I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish. </em>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits. <em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a Winning Facebook Ad Campaign, so you can see what you need to do and why. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select The Right Ad To Achieve Your Marketing Goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, engaging ads. Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel For Ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set Up Your First Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover The Customer Journey To Purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find Your Ideal Customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to hone in on your perfect customer. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting The Most Out Of The Facebook Pixel And Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and fast.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events To Take Your Ad Game To The Next Level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to get more from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Convert More, Sell Faster</strong></p><p>You'll receive my exclusive techniques for maximising your ad conversion rate on facebook. Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages. I'll be sharing what these are, and how you can easily implement them in my course.</p><p><strong>Create Compelling Ad Copy That Sells</strong></p><p>You'll also get a comprehensive quick start to copywriting master, so you can create copy that engages right off the bat. This guide was authored by a professional copywriter, who will share the essential secrets you need to know to get people to take the actions you want.</p><p><strong>Why Do You Need This Course?</strong></p><p>The digital marketplace is changing fast and there\u2019s just so much competition out there.

Their role is actually quite simple. They help us answer three questions: What do I want to change about myself, How do I change,&nbsp; How do I commit to changing, Whether it\u2019s being a better lawyer, a leader or manager or whether it\u2019s more personal, such as getting in shape, losing weight, being a better parent, change starts with identifying what you want to change about yourself, figuring out how to get from here to there and making that change a reality. Life coaches help you do this. They help you to get to know yourself better, define what you really want and work with you on how to get it. Successful individuals set goals and pursue them. When we feel stuck, we\u2019re in a rut, or we find ourselves asking, How did I get here? we know we need to make a change, but we have difficulty defining the change and have less of an idea of how to make it.&nbsp; life coach helps you answer these questions.</p><p>A life coach can lead you to water but can\u2019t make you drink. A life coach can help you devise a plan, but he can\u2019t execute the plan.&nbsp; life coach can give you the tools, but won\u2019t build the house for you. The hard work\u2014getting up every morning and working toward your goals every day, in both small and big ways\u2014that\u2019s all you.&nbsp; life coach will help you design the blueprint, but you mix and pour the concrete, saw the wood and build.</p><p>This is where most dreams fail. This is where the best of intentions only get you so far. This is where it\u2019s you changing, ever so incrementally, step by step, inch by inch, making a new you. Your life coach can offer advice, motivation and inspiration but you\u2019re the one on the field. You\u2019re the one running and hustling, blocking and tackling, throwing and receiving, making the moves and making the plays. In short, a life coach is just that a coach</p><p>a life coach helps you figure things out, but once you have strategy, it\u2019s up to you to execute. he\u2019s not there to hold your hand or carry you across the finish line. he helps you be the brains of the operation. good life coach has a process for you to follow to determine what you want to change, how to change it and how to stick with it through the end. You two are co-architects and you\u2019re the contractor.</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4708138", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Eigene Website mit Jimdo erstellen", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Kristoffer Ditz", "duration": "150", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "367", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4708138_b9f9_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/eigene-website-mit-jimdo-erstellen/?couponCode=195D0BDF23483FF53CE1", "end_day": "2022-06-05 10:34:00+00:00", "headline": "Lernen Sie, wie Sie eine kostenlose Website und/oder Onlineshop mit Jimdo erstellen", "description": "<p><strong>Allgemein</strong></p><p>Wenn Sie selbstst\u00e4ndig sind und noch keine Website haben, oder gerne wissen m\u00f6chten, wie Sie sich kostenlos eine eigene Website erstellen k\u00f6nnen, ist dieser Online-Kurs der richtige f\u00fcr Sie!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Hinweis I:</em></strong><em> Eine Anmeldung f\u00fcr eine kostenlose Website bei Jimdo ist hilfreich (Link im Kurs enthalten), aber nicht erforderlich</em> </p><p><br></p><p>Mit dem Baukasten-System <strong>Jimdo </strong>werden Sie lernen, wie Sie in k\u00fcrzester Zeit Ihre eigene Website bzw.

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \"stone\" in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles' successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.</p><p> LEARN Harmful Effects of Fungi: </p><p>1. Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp;

Flutter is an SDK providing the tooling to compile Dart code into native code and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so-called widgets) which you can use to compose your user interfaces.</p><p><strong>Flutter is extremely trending</strong> and gets used for major Google apps like their Adwords app - it's now marked as \"ready for production\", hence now is the time to jump in and learn it!</p><p>This course will teach Flutter from scratch, NO prior knowledge of either of the two is required! And you certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.</p><p>You'll learn Flutter not only in theory but<strong> we'll build a complete, realistic app</strong> throughout this course. This app will feature both all the core basics as well as advanced features like using Google Maps, the device camera, adding animations and more!</p><p><strong>With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play.</strong></p><p>Use Google's Material Design to build beautiful, yet fully customizable, apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements like buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists and more - or you simply build your own widgets - Flutter makes that a breeze, too.</p><p><strong>Here's what's included in the course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Detailed setup instructions for&nbsp; Windows.</p></li><li><p>A thorough introduction to Flutter and the concept behind widgets.</p></li><li><p>An overview of the built-in widgets and how you may add your own ones</p></li><li><p>Page navigation with tabs, side drawers and stack-based navigation</p></li><li><p>State management solutions</p></li><li><p>Handling and validating user input</p></li><li><p>Connecting your Flutter app to backend servers by sending Http requests</p></li><li><p>User authentication</p></li><li><p>Using native device features like the camera</p></li><li><p>Adding beautiful animations &amp; page transitions</p></li><li><p>Image Upload</p></li></ul><p>And more!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course is for you if ...</strong></p><ul><li><p>You're interested in building real native mobile apps for the two most popular mobile platforms - iOS and Android</p></li><li><p>You want to explore the full set of features Flutter offers</p></li><li><p>Don't want to spend hours learning two completely different languages</p></li></ul>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "Arabic"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1396126", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Game Development", "title": "Learn How to Make Trading Card Game Menus With Unity 3D", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Sandor Kiss", "duration": "450", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "139", "students": "30182", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1396126_88f2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-make-trading-card-game-menus-with-unity-3d/?couponCode=JUNE01", "end_day": "2022-06-07 16:49:00+00:00", "headline": "A full guide on menus and collection management in trading card games with Unity 3D.", "description": "<p>This course provides a full guide on trading card game menus. In the video Lectures we cover only the process of making menus, collection browsing, deck building, pack opening, etc\u2026 But the battle mechanics part is also included into the Unity project that is provided with the course. So, you`ll have an opportunity to play the game with the cards that you create yourself or even use this application as a foundation for your own trading card game.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>The material in this course is divided into 5 Sections. Section 1 features a short introduction to the course.\u00a0 \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Unity project that we are developing in this course can be treated as an extension of the course that we have made earlier about card game battle mechanics, in Section 2 we will make a recap of the techniques that we use in both courses to store cards in the project. You will learn about ScriptableObjects and ScriptableObject assets and how you can use them to store cards in your project. We`ll take a look at a very useful script CardCollection.cs that will be used in the project to filter the cards in our collection and get certain sub-sets of cards that satisfy certain criteria. In the last Lecture of Section 2 we`ll do some UI work in Unity and assemble the general layout of our menu scene.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Section 3 will be entirely dedicated to buying and opening booster packs with cards. It makes sense to make the card pack opening part early in the course because it`s both the most exciting part of the project and at the same time the most isolated from other code. We`ll create a separate screen for the shop / pack opening area and explore all the scripts that make it possible to buy and open card packs. We`ll cover advanced topics like: drag and drop code for the unopened packs, using DOTween to automate movement of unopened packs and cards that we get from packs, displaying hover over effects, generating cards of certain rarity based on customizable probability coefficients. By the end of this Section we`ll have a fully functioning pack opening screen for this project.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Section 4 we will start making the collection screen \u2013 the most complicated screen in the menus for any trading card game. Our goal for this Section is to be able to launch the game and see the cards laid out in a grid on the collection screen, be able to use pagination buttons and switch pages in the collection, be able to use all the custom filters (mana, keyword, belonging to one of the character classes) to filter the card collection and display certain sub-sets of our collection.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the final section of this course we will continue exploring our collection screen and cover more advanced objects that are featured on the screen: crafting screen that allows us to craft new cards for one of the in-game currencies, scrollable lists with deck icons and card icons that will be displayed on the side of our deck building screen. We will discuss the topic of transferring data between the scenes and being able to use the deck that your players have pre-configured in the battle scene. In the final lecture of the course I`ll demonstrate how you can set up a game against a simple AI opponent. \n\n  We saved the project a couple of times while we were making the course and you`ll have these saved projects available for download. I would recommend to download the final project first, check out how it works and start your exploration of this app from the final version. All the art assets that are used to create cards, creatures, hero powers and other game elements are free for commercial use. You can find detailed info on art and scripting assets and links to some other useful resources in the Credits file that you can download with this course (included in the root of the Assets folder in any of the saved projects).</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4656368", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "Water Supply System A-Z - Mechanical Engineering", "level": "All Levels", "author": "EngineeringHub Academy", "duration": "105", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "8", "students": "2982", "coupon_code": "7D25749FB6D1607993C2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4656368_1844.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/mechanical-engineering-full-water-supply-system-a-z/?couponCode=8F054C19A239E57C7C43", "end_day": "2022-06-03 07:00:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn basics of Water Supply System with examples and spare parts description", "description": "<p>Hi!

It\u2019s a $3 billion global business where the median rate for executive coaches is $500 an hour.</p><p>The news gets even better. You can be a <strong>management coach</strong> from where ever you are. I have worked with clients throughout North America, the UK, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark. So can you.

But the best way to serve them is to help them reach their own conclusions about how to excel as a top executive. You do this by asking really smart, thoughtful, insightful, and challenging questions. I will give you some of the most results oriented questions that I\u2019ve used with my clients. But don\u2019t stop there. After your client answers your question, ask a probing follow up question. Encourage them to go even deeper.</p><p>Are you a business specialist? No problem. Your expertise in HR, technology, marketing, investor relations will serve to help specific clients see what\u2019s possible in their careers.</p><p>Take me for example. I help clients who are smart, talented, and experienced but have a hard time communicating their ideas in certain business situations. That hurts their careers and the company\u2019s bottom line. I give them the communications tools they need and the confidence to succeed.</p><p>General business help in invaluable, too. You see the bigger picture and help your clients make the right moves.</p><p>What about you? We tend to take for granted what we know. Don\u2019t make that assumption.

They could be individuals who know they need to get a leg up in order to get to the next step in their careers.
