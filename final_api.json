Labeling costs by category of fixed and variable can seem unnatural at first, because we often label costs by function, what the cost is designed to do, like operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Labeling cost by behavior helps us see how the cost changes with relation to increases in production level, a useful concept for projecting into the future. </p><p>The course will show how to calculate the break-even point and the cash break-even point.

It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.</p><p>&nbsp; It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula 150 millions people speak Arabic&nbsp; to learn its vocabularies you should listen to Arabic speakers in every field listen before speak the Arabic grammar&nbsp; &nbsp;is very important to know the structure of the sentence s </p><p>how can I speak like native&nbsp; listen to drama listen to old songs listen to sport listen to cartoon video clips&nbsp; &nbsp;all in Arabic try to repeat the words and phrases</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1698012", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Language Learning", "title": "Business Englisch f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger-Sicher im t\u00e4glichen Gebrauch", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Loretta Huether", "duration": "227", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "310", "students": "5910", "coupon_code": "1414371BD1823EEB0B1B", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1698012_4f4f_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/business-english-fur-anfanger-taglichen-gebrauche-im-buro/?couponCode=21F60500853E3C47A876", "end_day": "2022-05-25 07:04:00+00:00", "headline": "N\u00fctzliche Englische Vokabeln und Redewendungen f\u00fcr Arbeit, Beruf und Bewerbung.", "description": "<p>Finden Sie es manchmal <strong>schwierig, mit Ihren Kollegen auf Englisch zu kommunizieren?</strong> <br>Werden Sie <strong>nerv\u00f6s</strong>, wenn andere Menschen Sie auf Englisch ansprechen? <br>Haben Sie Schwierigkeiten<strong> E-Mails auf Englisch </strong>zu lesen und zu schreiben? <br>Haben Sie <strong>Angst, wenn Sie ans Telefon gehen</strong> oder einen Anruf t\u00e4tigen m\u00fcssen?</p><p>Sie stehen mit diesen Problemen und \u00c4ngsten nicht alleine da, denn viele Menschen haben mit dem Englisch am Arbeitsplatz zu k\u00e4mpfen.

Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp; &nbsp;metabolism of fungi&nbsp; Metabolism of fungi fungi preferer moist habitat they are heterophilic need carbon in soluble form of carbohydrate as carbon in environment is found as complex polymer they use their own enzyme like cellulase chitinase in degrading cellulose lignin Fungi cannot fix gaseous nitrogen but they can utilize nitrate ammonia some amino acids by direct uptake by hyphal membrane they can utilize more complex nitrogen sources such as protein and peptides as they can utilize extracellular proteases that degrade amino acids into amino acids Fungi require macro and micronutrients sometimes vitamins fungal genetic&nbsp;

This is particularly important for samples that contain new or rare viruses for which diagnostic tests are not yet developed&nbsp; Many viruses can be grown in cell culture in the lab.</p><p>To do this, the virus sample is mixed with cells, a process called adsorption, after which the cells become infected and produce more copies of the virus&nbsp; &nbsp;Although different viruses often only grow in certain types of cells, there are cells that support the growth of a large variety of viruses and are a good starting point, for example, the African monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEp-2). One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome. Hence, it provides the most information about very small differences between two viruses that would look the same using other diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>Viral replication</strong> is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.&nbsp; Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.</p><p>Through the generation of abundant copies of its genome and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts. Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells.

The virus takes advantage of the existing cell structures to replicate itself</p><p><strong>synthesis of virus components</strong>[</p><p>The components are manufactured by the virus using the host's existing organelles:</p><p>\u2022Viral proteins: Viral mRNA is translated on cellular ribosomes into two types of viral protein:</p><p>\u2022Structural: proteins which make up the virus particle</p><p>\u2022Nonstructural: proteins not found in the virus particle, mainly enzymes for virus genome replication </p><p>Viral nucleic acid (genome replication): New viral genomes are synthesized; templates are either the parental genome or newly formed complementary strands, in the case of single-stranded genomes. These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using integrase. Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases </p><p><strong>class 7: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate </strong>This small group of viruses, exemplified by the Hepatitis B virus, have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle&nbsp; (ccc DNA) that serves as a template for production of viral mRNAs and a sub genomic RNA. The progenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase and for production of the DNA genome.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4115696", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Financial Modeling & Analysis", "title": "Corporate Finance #11 Capital Budgeting", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "853", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "43", "students": "19513", "coupon_code": "1414371BD1823EEB0B1B", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4115696_2d4e.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-finance-11-capital-budgeting/?couponCode=65E0E51074217A21D896", "end_day": "2022-05-25 06:35:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to make capital budgeting decisions from a certified public accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will show how to make capital budgeting decisions from a corporate finance perspective.</p><p>We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems.
