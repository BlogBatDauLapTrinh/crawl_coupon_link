This includes HTML, CSS, &amp;&nbsp;Bootstrap. Each section comes complete with comprehensive lessons that help students master the art of front-end coding. </p><p>The course is divided as follows:</p><p><strong>HTML Development</strong></p><p>This section explores HTML. HTML is a key fundamental building block when learning to develop websites. Students initially learn the basics of HTML page structure and gradually transition into working with spacing, text formatting, lists, images, videos, links, anchors, tables, forms and much more. We include several projects, where students are shown first-hand, how to develop and code html web pages from scratch.</p><p><strong>CSS Development</strong></p><p>Students learn to use CSS to create stylish, responsive web page layouts. We start by discussing the parts and types of CSS rules, followed by CSS classes, DIVS, and ID's. Students gain significant exposure to various formatting options, including margins, padding, font properties, backgrounds, transparency, positioning, link styling and CSS tables. This section includes a hands-on web development project where students utilize the concepts explored in the lesson.</p><p><strong>Bootstrap Framework</strong></p><p>Students are taught to use the Bootstrap framework for responsive, mobile-first - front-end development. As one of the leading open-source development libraries, Bootstrap is an essential part of the developers coding arsenal. The section begins with teaching students how to include essential Bootstrap files into web pages. It then explores the Bootstrap Grid system and popular layout strategies for optimal cross-device and cross-browser compatibility.</p><p>Students gain exposure to just about every Bootstrap component, from typography, tables and images, to jumbotrons, wells, alerts, buttons, glyphicons and progress bars. The section includes several hands-on exercises that will walk students through the process of creating stunning layouts, complete with modals, carousels, popovers, drop-down menus, forms and much more.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3878694", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Other Personal Development", "title": "TOP G1 driver\u2019s license Practice Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "3.4", "reviews": "24", "students": "8638", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3878694_f0e8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/top-g1-drivers-license-practice-tests-ontario-canada/?couponCode=493060CE5FD6C1FB7CBC", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:00:00+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Most Common Questions for G1 Practice Tests for Ontario and Canadian driver\u2019s license", "description": "<p><strong>G1 Test Practice: Free ON \u201cDrive Test\u201d G1 Practice Test 2021</strong></p><p><strong><em>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our <strong>G1 Practice Test</strong> with multiple choice questions, is intended to help you prepare for the <strong>Ontario G1 practice test</strong> and learners driver\u2019s test that is required before you can get your <strong>Canadian driver\u2019s license</strong>.</p><p>This free practice Written G1 driving test is a lesson that is essential for getting your Ontario driver\u2019s license at your local licensing office.<br>Please note, however, that this is not the actual test, and you will not receive your license if you pass this practice test.</p><p><br></p><p>Our <strong>most popular G1 practice test.</strong> Once you are 16, you may visit a Drive Test location and test for the Ontario G1 license with a written knowledge test of 40 multiple-choice questions. The G1 test is divided into two parts: 20 questions on road signs, and 20 questions on rules of the road. You must correctly answer 16 questions in each section to pass the test. In addition to the written exam, you will also need to pass a vision test and pay a $158.25 package fee, which will cover your knowledge test, eventual G2 driver\u2019s test, and your five-year license. If you need to retake the written exam, it will be an additional $15.75. The Ontario G1 driver\u2019s test is based on the 2021 Ontario Driver\u2019s Handbook and questions from the test will be pulled directly from the guide. Ontario has set in place a graduated driver\u2019s license (GDL) program that takes about two years to complete. After you pass your written test at Drive Test, you must hold your G1 license for one year, or 8 months if you are enrolled in a driver training program before you may take your first drive test to qualify for a G2 license. The G1 license will allow you to practice your driving skills under the supervision of a fully licensed driver. Our G1 practice tests use the same scoring system as the Drive Test centers across the province, so there will be no surprises when you go there. </p><p><strong>Road Tests/Driving Exams</strong></p><p>There are two types of road tests that you might have to take-for the G2 and full G-levels of the Ontario driver\u2019s license. New drivers must pass both driving exams before they can obtain a full license. You might also be asked to complete a road test if you meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>If you are a <strong>foreign driver</strong> you might be asked to complete at least one road test depending on your country of origin and level of documented experience</p></li><li><p>If you are <strong>renewing an expired license</strong> that was a G1 or G2 license, or a full G license that expired more than 12 months ago</p></li><li><p>If you are renewing your license and are 80 years of age or older you might be asked to pass a driving exam</p></li><li><p>If you are reinstating a license that was suspended 3+ years ago</p></li></ul><p>No matter what level your road test is, you should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled time with a vehicle (owned, borrowed, or rented) as it will not be provided for you.</p><p><strong>G2 Road Test</strong></p><p>The G2 driving exam is designed to test your basic driving skills. It lasts around 20 minutes and is performed entirely on city streets, with no testing done on any 400-series highways. The examiner will have you perform basic driving maneuvers, including:</p><ul><li><p>Starting, stopping and turning the vehicle</p></li><li><p>Obeying traffic stops and signs</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and driving in passing lanes</p></li><li><p>Driving through all types of intersections (with lights and stop signs)</p></li><li><p>Forward, reverse, and parallel parking</p></li><li><p>Reversing, 3-point turns, U-turns</p></li></ul><p><strong>How long do you have to wait to get your G2?</strong></p><p>If you are a new driver trying to get your G2 license for the first time, you have to wait 8 to 12 months after you pass the G1 written exam. If you complete a certified driving school, you only have to wait for 8 months instead of the full year.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G2 test?</strong></p><p>If you fail your G2 test, you will have to wait 10 days before you can take it again. Depending on the time of the year, this could take longer if there are no bookings available.</p><p><strong>G Road Test</strong></p><p>The G driving exam includes everything from the G2 exam, but also tests you on more advanced driving skills- mainly, driving on highways. They last around 30 minutes and new drivers will need to have their G2 for at least 8-12 months before they can take the G road test. The skills you will be tested on that are new to the G exam include:</p><ul><li><p>Merging onto a 400-series highway at the proper speed</p></li><li><p>Passing other vehicles and changing lanes</p></li><li><p>Exiting the highway</p></li></ul><p><strong>How many mistakes are allowed on the G and G2 driving tests?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of mistakes that could lead to passing or failing a G or G2 exam. For instance, minor infractions like merging too late or failing to signal could just lead to negative points, while one major mistake such as speeding in a school zone would be grounds for an immediate fail. However, making too many minor mistakes could also lead to failing the exam.</p><p><strong>What happens if I fail my G test?</strong></p><p>If you fail the G road test you will have to wait around 10 days before you can take it again. It depends on how soon you can book an available time to take the test, so depending on the time of year it could take longer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4062654", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Email Monetization Mastery 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Henry Zhang", "duration": "51", "rating": "3.6", "reviews": "39", "students": "17768", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4062654_2aab_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/henry-zhang-email-monetization-mini-course/?couponCode=315A062BD614C2F26310", "end_day": "2022-04-21 23:46:00+00:00", "headline": "How to join the ranks of successful list builders quickly and easily to increase engagement and build your tribes !", "description": "<p><strong>Turning your email list into a passive income money maker isn\u2019t as difficult, or time consuming as you may think.</strong></p><p>Every day, thousands of online marketers are transforming their mailing lists into powerful cash funnels, and quite often, they don\u2019t even have their own product line!</p><p>This course will make it easy for you to start making money with your subscriber base even if you\u2019re just starting out.</p><p>It will show you how you can join the ranks of successful list builders quickly and easily, while increasing engagement, building your tribe and positioning yourself as a thought leader in your market.</p><p><strong>The Email Monetization Course For EVERY Level</strong></p><p>This course is your fast track to Email Monetization success and will provide long-lasting value from your very first product designed right through to advanced sales and marketing campaigns.

The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS). The test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.</p><p>According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning. The content of the GRE consists of certain specific algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and vocabulary sections. The GRE General Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at testing centers and institution owned or authorized by Prometric. In the graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely between schools and departments within schools. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to an important selection factor.</p><p>The GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an exam that is not adaptive on a question-by-question basis, but rather by section, so that the performance on the first verbal and math sections determines the difficulty of the second sections presented. Overall, the test retained the sections and many of the question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was changed to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale).</p><p>The cost to take the test is US$205, although ETS will reduce the fee under certain circumstances. It also provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. ETS does not release scores that are older than five years, although graduate program policies on the acceptance of scores older than five years will vary.</p><p>The Graduate Record Examinations was \"initiated in 1936 as a joint experiment in higher education by the graduate school deans of four Ivy League universities and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\"</p><p>The first universities to experiment the test on their students were Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University and Columbia University. The University of Wisconsin was the first public university to ask their students to take the test in 1938. It was first given to students at the University of Iowa in 1940, where it was analysed by psychologist Dewey Stuit. It was first taken by students at Texas Tech University in 1942.In 1943, it was taken by students at Michigan State University, where it was analyzed by Paul Dressel.It was taken by over 45,000 students applying to 500 colleges in 1948.</p><p>\"Until the Educational Testing Service was established in January, 1948, the Graduate Record Examination remained a project of the Carnegie Foundation.\"</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3607614", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "SAS Certified Associate SAS Programming Fundamentals", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "35", "students": "18996", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3607614_3da6_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/sas-certified-associate-sas-programming-fundamentals/?couponCode=C47EFFAF68F110D289D8", "end_day": "2022-04-25 16:11:00+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Programming Fundamentals Using SAS 9.4", "description": "<p><strong><em>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SAS Certified Associate</strong>: <strong>Programming Fundamentals Using SAS 9.4</strong>.

Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called <em>edges</em>. Neurons and edges typically have a <em>weight</em> that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.</p><p><strong>Deep learning</strong> (also known as <strong>deep structured learning</strong>) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p><p>Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.</p><p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue.</p><p>The adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the \"structured\" part.</p><p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to <strong>natural intelligence</strong> displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.</p><p>Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.</p><p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p><p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "2292573", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Process Costing System-Cost Accounting-Managerial Accounting", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "479", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "128", "students": "35251", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2292573_2c39.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/process-costing-system-cost-accounting-managerial-accounting/?couponCode=2C25113CB04118F43653", "end_day": "2022-04-24 06:35:00+00:00", "headline": "Process costing system-managerial accounting or cost accounting including equivalent unit calculation & journal entries", "description": "<p>Process costing system \u2013 Cost Accounting \u2013 Managerial Accounting</p><p>We will start by introducing managerial accounting or cost accounting topics that apply to companies that manufacture using either a job cost system or a process cost system.</p><p>The course will describe classifications for costs and the importance of being able to classify costs in different ways.</p><p>We will list and describe an outline of the process costs go through as they flow through the accounting process in a manufacturing company.</p><p>The course will compare the two major systems used to track inventory costs in a manufacturing company, the job cost system, and the process costs system.

The certifications are developed and maintained through a vigorous process. The certification program includes: Certified Associate in Project Management(CAPM)\u00ae certification PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)\u00ae certification PMI Risk Management Professional(PMI-RMP)\u00aecertification PMI Scheduling Professional(PMI-SP)\u00aecertification Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP) \u00ae certification Program Management Professional (PgMP)\u00ae certification Project Management Professional(PMP)\u00ae certification PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)\u00ae certification PMI\u2019s certifications are distinguished by their global development and application, which makes them transferable across industries and geographic borders. The strength of PMI\u2019s certifications is that they are portable and not tied to any single method, standard or organization. PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification.

This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. <br><br>The term \u201cScalable Cloud Computing\u201d has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.<br><br>To illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201cInstance\u201d we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.<strong> </strong>This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. <br><br>Similar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,<strong> </strong>virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.<strong> </strong>These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.<br><br>The level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.<br><br>Beyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).</p><p>In addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Exploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Types</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users for EC2</p></li><li><p>Deploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs</p></li><li><p>Assigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Administration </p></li><li><p>Creating Security Groups for Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>Remote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY&nbsp;for Windows.</p></li><li><p>Using EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances. </p></li></ul><p>If you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4325468", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "Improving software development productivity", "level": "All Levels", "author": "ANDRII SVIATOBATKO", "duration": "311", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "36", "students": "13282", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4325468_3029_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/improving-software-development-productivity/?couponCode=47D5E18C3A4030A81F52", "end_day": "2022-04-25 18:18:00+00:00", "headline": "Improving software development productivity.

The abbreviation \"IQ\" was coined by the psychologist William Stern for the German term <em>Intelligenzquotient</em>, his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912 book.</p><p>Historically, IQ was a score obtained by dividing a person's mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person's chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months. The resulting fraction (quotient) was multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score. For modern IQ tests, the raw score is transformed to a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15.This results in approximately two-thirds of the population scoring between IQ 85 and IQ 115 and about 2.5 percent each above 130 and below 70.</p><p>Scores from intelligence tests are estimates of intelligence. Unlike, for example, distance and mass, a concrete measure of intelligence cannot be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of \"intelligence\".IQ scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as nutrition,[8][9] parental socioeconomic status,morbidity and mortality,[12][13] parental social status,[14] and perinatal environment.While the heritability of IQ has been investigated for nearly a century, there is still debate about the significance of heritability estimates[16][17] and the mechanisms of inheritance.</p><p>IQ scores are used for educational placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants. In research contexts, they have been studied as predictors of job performance and income.They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4554452", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Science", "title": "School Physics Class 12 Practical Tests and Answers", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "1", "students": "3519", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4554452_2aa7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/school-physics-class-12-practical-tests-and-answers/?couponCode=97B745034E570548740A", "end_day": "2022-04-25 16:22:00+00:00", "headline": "[Part 2 of 2] Physics Lovers Save your Time and Effort \u2026..

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.</p><p>Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps <em>the</em> oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.</p><p>Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.</p><p><br></p><p>Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.</p><p>Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialized, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"Universalists\" such as Einstein (1879\u20131955) and Lev Landau (1908\u20131968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3877348", "category": "Lifestyle", "sub_category": "Travel", "title": "2022 Commercial Driver\u2019s License Practice Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "18", "students": "8804", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3877348_a5ee_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/trucks-cars-tesla-commercial-drivers-license-practice-tests/?couponCode=15AF13FB853A0F835E53", "end_day": "2022-04-25 16:57:00+00:00", "headline": "97% Pass in First Attempt Easily Commercial Driver\u2019s License Practice Test", "description": "<p><strong>Commercial Driver\u2019s License Practice Test</strong></p><p><strong><em>97% Pass in First Attempt Easily</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Endorsements on your <strong>Commercial Driver\u2019s License</strong> open you up to many more Truck Job Opportunities.

Truck drivers operating vehicles with either a double or triple trailer need this endorsement.</p><p><strong>Passenger Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>Although the S-endorsement is also a passenger endorsement, the passenger endorsement practice test would also apply to those transporting special education students, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and any other drivers in the business of transporting passengers.</p><p><strong>Tanker Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>A tank vehicle is used to carry any liquids or gaseous materials in tanks. Due to the sensitive nature of this work and this endorsement, tanker endorsement practice tests are highly recommended. Practicing for your N-endorsement can ensure that you understand the safety procedures and can pass the test on the first attempt.</p><p><strong>Hazardous Materials Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>The H-endorsement is one of the toughest to get on your commercial driver\u2019s license because it requires a background check and a security clearance from the Department of Homeland Security. Don\u2019t ruin your chances by failing the written test. Use hazardous materials practice tests to pass the one aspect of this process you can control.</p><p><strong>Combo Tanker and HAZMAT Endorsement Test</strong></p><p>This endorsement test combines the N and H endorsements into a single endorsement allowing operation of tank vehicles transporting of liquid or gaseous hazardous material. To receive this endorsement, you do need to go for both endorsements separately, as each endorsement has different requirements.

It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.

There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4114216", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Language Learning", "title": "Learn Egyptian Arabic through Cartoons", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Mister Bakoor", "duration": "129", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "54", "students": "20908", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4114216_6b81_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-egyptian-arabic-through-animation/?couponCode=1A312828506BA1B6B6B6", "end_day": "2022-04-22 16:11:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Egyptian Arabic : Egyptian dialect through Egyptian colloquial Cartoon", "description": "<p>This is actually a new idea in teaching a foreign language , Hello everyone.

It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is a subfield of microbiology.</p><p>The identification of the causative agent of tobacco mosaic disease (TMV) as a novel pathogen by Martinus Beijerinck (1898) is now acknowledged as being the official beginning of the field of virology as a discipline distinct from bacteriology. He realized the source was neither a bacterial nor a fungal infection, but something completely different. Beijerinck used the word \u2018virus\u2019 to describe the mysterious agent in his \u2018contagium vivum fluidum\u2019 (\u2018contagious living fluid\u2019). Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955.</p><p>A major branch of virology is virus classification. Viruses can be classified according to the host cell they infect: animal viruses, plant viruses, fungal viruses, and bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacteria, which include the most complex viruses). Another classification uses the geometrical shape of their capsid (often a helix or an icosahedron) or the virus's structure (e.g. presence or absence of a lipid envelope). Viruses range in size from about 30 nm to about 450 nm, which means that most of them cannot be seen with light microscopes. The shape and structure of viruses has been studied by electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.</p><p>The most useful and most widely used classification system distinguishes viruses according to the type of nucleic acid they use as genetic material and the viral replication method they employ to coax host cells into producing more viruses:</p><ul><li><p>DNA viruses (divided into double-stranded DNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses),</p></li><li><p>RNA viruses (divided into positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and the much less common double-stranded RNA viruses),</p></li><li><p>reverse transcribing viruses (double-stranded reverse-transcribing DNA viruses and single-stranded reverse-transcribing RNA viruses including retroviruses).</p></li></ul><p>Virologists also study <em>subviral particles</em>, infectious entities notably smaller and simpler than viruses:</p><ul><li><p>viroids (naked circular RNA molecules infecting plants),</p></li><li><p>satellites (nucleic acid molecules with or without a capsid that require a helper virus for infection and reproduction), and</p></li><li><p>prions (proteins that can exist in a pathological conformation that induces other prion molecules to assume that same conformation).</p></li></ul><p>Taxa in virology are not necessarily monophyletic, as the evolutionary relationships of the various virus groups remain unclear. Three hypotheses regarding their origin exist:</p><ol><li><p>Viruses arose from non-living matter, separately from yet in parallel to cells, perhaps in the form of self-replicating RNA ribozymes similar to viroids.</p></li><li><p>Viruses arose by genome reduction from earlier, more competent cellular life forms that became parasites to host cells and subsequently lost most of their functionality; examples of such tiny parasitic prokaryotes are Mycoplasma and Nanoarchaea.</p></li><li><p>Viruses arose from mobile genetic elements of cells (such as transposons, retrotransposons or plasmids) that became encapsulated in protein capsids, acquired the ability to \"break free\" from the host cell and infect other cells.</p></li></ol><p>Of particular interest here is mimivirus, a giant virus that infects amoebae and encodes much of the molecular machinery traditionally associated with bacteria. Two possibilities are that it is a simplified version of a parasitic prokaryote or it originated as a simpler virus that acquired genes from its host.</p><p>The evolution of viruses, which often occurs in concert with the evolution of their hosts, is studied in the field of viral evolution.</p><p>While viruses reproduce and evolve, they do not engage in metabolism, do not move, and depend on a host cell for reproduction. The often-debated question of whether they are alive or not is a matter of definition that does not affect the biological reality of viruses.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3930700", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "2022 Program Management Professional (PMI PgMP\u00ae)", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "36", "students": "13164", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3930700_4227.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/program-management-professional-pmi-pgmp/?couponCode=A291A7D59EF4327CD5A1", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:02:00+00:00", "headline": "Get Ready to be Program Management Professional (PMI PgMP\u00ae) based on American project management institute PMI", "description": "<p><strong>2022 Program Management Professional (PMI PgMP\u00ae)</strong></p><p><strong>Get Ready to be Program Management Professional (PMI PgMP\u00ae) based on American project management institute PMI</strong></p><p><br></p><p>About the PgMP Certification The PgMP certification recognizes advanced experience, skill and performance in the oversight of multiple, related projects and their resources aligned with an organizational objective. PgMP certification holders oversee the success of a program \u2014 a way to group multiple, related projects to achieve benefits that may not be realized if the projects were managed in a stand-alone fashion. As project managers advance in their careers, the experience they gain in managing multiple, related projects and making decisions that advance strategic and business objectives demonstrates this competence. As employers demand program managers who can support the strategic objectives of the organization, PgMP certification holders will gain a distinct advantage in employment and promotional opportunities over their peers. PgMP Certifying Process Overview You must pass two evaluations to obtain the PgMP certification. This process takes approximately 60 days to complete. Evaluation 1\u2014Panel Review: The initial evaluation occurs through an extensive application review during which a panel of certified program managers will assess your professional experience based on your responses to the Program Management Experience Summaries provided on the application. Evaluation 2\u2014Multiple-Choice Examination: The next step occurs with the multiple-choice examination in which you will be called upon to demonstrate your competence in both situational and scenario-basedquestions.</p><p><br></p><p>About PMI\u2019s Certification Program PMI offers a comprehensive certification program for practitioners with different levels of education and experience. The certifications are developed and maintained through a vigorous process. The certification program includes: Certified Associate in Project Management(CAPM)\u00ae certification PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)\u00ae certification PMI Risk Management Professional(PMI-RMP)\u00aecertification PMI Scheduling Professional(PMI-SP)\u00aecertification Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP) \u00ae certification Program Management Professional (PgMP)\u00ae certification Project Management Professional(PMP)\u00ae certification PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)\u00ae certification PMI\u2019s certifications are distinguished by their global development and application, which makes them transferable across industries and geographic borders. The strength of PMI\u2019s certifications is that they are portable and not tied to any single method, standard or organization. PMI\u2019s certification program is designed to ensure that all certification holders have demonstrated their competence through fair and valid measures. Steps are taken to ensure only the most reliable testing measures are used in the assessment of candidates. For example, interviews can be influenced by how difficult the interviewer tends to be, how well the candidate is performing that day, and even how many questions the interviewer asks along the same line of questioning. PMI certifications are also developed by project management practitioners for practitioners. The certification program is driven by the thousands of certification holders who volunteer to spend time constructing and refining the exam questions used by PMI. These volunteers represent the diversity of PMI\u2019s market, coming from every region of the world, industry, job level and experience level. The exam questions are monitored through industry-standard statistical procedures, also overseen by volunteers. PMI understands the importance of impartiality in carrying out its certification activities, manages conflict of interest and ensures the objectivity of its certification activities. A candidate is assessed by examining his or her competence using: Education and Experience \u2013 A combination of education and/or experience in project management is required for each certification. For example, the PMP requires both training specifically in project management and experience in the role of a project manager by leading and directing project teams, while delivering project results. Testing Competence \u2013 The candidate is required to apply project management concepts and experience to potential on-the-job situations through a series of scenario-based questions. Ongoing Development \u2013 Maintenance of a PMI certification requires the accumulation of ongoing professional development and education or, in some cases, recertification.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3933610", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Database Testing MySQL and PostgreSQL practical tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "49", "students": "25098", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3933610_fb31.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/database-testing-sqllit-mysql-and-postgresql-practical-tests/?couponCode=1F39EC98D1A065784B2E", "end_day": "2022-04-25 17:03:00+00:00", "headline": "Test your skills as Database Administrator and developer", "description": "<p><strong>Database Testing MySQL and PostgreSQL practical tests</strong></p><p><strong>Test your skills as Database Administrator and developer </strong></p><p><br></p><p>A <strong>database</strong> is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.</p><p>&nbsp; It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula 150 millions people speak Arabic&nbsp; to learn its vocabularies you should listen to Arabic speakers in every field listen before speak the Arabic grammar&nbsp; &nbsp;is very important to know the structure of the sentence s </p><p>how can I speak like native&nbsp; listen to drama listen to old songs listen to sport listen to cartoon video clips&nbsp; &nbsp;all in Arabic try to repeat the words and phrases</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "4610160", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Tests", "level": "All Levels", "author": "SMARTER ACADEMY", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "2", "students": "1868", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4610160_4321.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-tests-o/?couponCode=4C788E9F7E21F38F2DA1", "end_day": "2022-04-25 16:26:00+00:00", "headline": "TOP professional and common questions about AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate", "description": "<p><strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Tests</strong></p><p><strong>TOP professional and common questions about AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate</strong></p><p><strong>Amazon Web Services, Inc.</strong> (<strong>AWS</strong>) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

The MAT is an admissions exam accepted by many graduate programs in the United States. Additionally, it is used by many high-IQ societies all over the world as an admission requirement. The MAT goal is to assess logical and analytical reasoning through completion of partial analogies. The test duration is 1 hour and contains 120 questions. Exam formats include both <strong>Computer-Based Tests (CBT)</strong> and paper and pencil format.</p><p>This free practice exam features realistic questions that will help you not only review key vocabulary, but also familiarize yourself with the MAT\u2019s 120 Analogy exam format.

If you live more than one hundred miles away from a designated test center, special accommodations can be made. Dates will vary by testing site, so be sure to consult with the test site. The average fee to take the MAT is about $50, though that varies by region.</p><p><strong>Scores</strong></p><p>When you register to take the MAT, you are asked to provide up to three addresses that you wish to have your score reports sent.

It is also developed to measure how well the test taker can recognize relationships between words.</p><p>Vocabulary plays a very important role on this test. Before you can correctly identify the relationship that exists between the words, you must be able to recognize and comprehend the meaning of the answer choices.

It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \"stone\" in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft. In 1865, Beigel first described Piedra in The Human Hair: Its Structure, Growth, Diseases, and Their Treatment; although, he may have been describing Aspergillus infection. Cerqueira, tinea nigra in 1891 In 1910 Raymond Sabouraud published his book Les Teignes, which was a comprehensive study of dermatophytic fungi. He is also regarded as father of medical mycology. In 1927, Nan Nizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microspore gypsum. In 1927, Nannizzi reported the description of the sexual state of Microsporum gypseum the taxonomy of yeast fungi was described by Lodder and Kregervan Rij in 1952. The current classification of dermatophytes was published by Emmons in 1934 Finally, Gentles' successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin by in 1958 saved many patients with tinea capitis from permanent hair loss a common side effect after treatment with thallium importance of fungi Fungi inhabit almost every niche in the environment and humans are exposed to these organisms in various fields of life.</p><p> LEARN Harmful Effects of Fungi: </p><p>1. Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp;

Old are eligible to take the exam</p></li><li><p>Must be able to speak and write any of Canada\u2019s official languages (English and French)</p></li><li><p>Have been settling in Canada for 3 years out of the last 5 years before the day of application.</p></li><li><p>Have filed all taxes for at least 3 years during the last 5 years, note that all income taxes that you owe must be fully paid.</p></li></ul><p>Canadian Citizenship can only be obtained through a legal permanent residency in Canada or through the following.</p><p><strong>If the person is under 18 years of age,</strong> the guardian or the parent of the applicant will have to apply on behalf of them for a citizenship.</p><p><strong>If the person is over 18 years of age and have children,</strong> he/she can include application with your own.</p><p>Fast track citizenship application process is given to any member of the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces.</strong></p><p>Upon the day of the test, the applicant must present a letter of consent from the government informing the authorities on the actual day of your test, followed by an informal interview that can take up to 30 minutes and you will be asked to provide all the necessary documents for the citizenship test.</p><p>Each applicant must bring the following,</p><ul><li><p>Record of Landing (IMM 1000) or <em>Confirmation of Permanent Residence</em> (IMM 5292)</p></li><li><p>Permanent Resident Card (PRC).</p></li><li><p>One identity document which includes the applicant\u2019s photograph with signature.</p></li><li><p>Passports and all travel documents that the applicant possess.</p></li><li><p>Original copies of all supporting documents such as <em>Birth Certificate, Marriage Contract etc.</em></p></li></ul><p>After submitting the requirements, it will now be verified through the following information,</p><ul><li><p>Signature of the applicant on the notice form is necessary.</p></li><li><p>The signature provided in the notice form will be verified by comparing it to the signatures in the applicant\u2019s supporting documents.</p></li><li><p>Photos provided along with the supporting documents will be verified against the person in front of the official. This is the reason why your actual presence is really important.</p></li></ul><p>Take note, that applicants who fail to prove their identity will not be allowed to take the actual test. Citizenship officers will then check the original copies and will coordinate the authenticity of these documents to the corresponding consular offices.</p><p>Only those who completed the requirements will continue to take the exam, only certified copies or original copies of documents can be accepted as proof of application unless the applicant is currently applying for a replacement of certificate.</p><p>Now that the requirements are ready, time to schedule and pass the Canadian Citizenship Exam.</p><p><strong>The Test of Fate</strong></p><p>The test is based on a study guide by the government to determine the applicant\u2019s knowledge in Canadian history, geography, culture and politics.</p><p>The citizenship exam lasts for 30 minutes with 20 multiple questions, applicants who are taking up the exam must answer at least 15 correct questions out of 20 to pass the exam.</p><p>Passing rate for the last 5 years is more than 60%, but rest assured that this test is not as easy as your history lessons. The exam is totally different, imagine for instance, an immigrant who have been a Filipino citizen for his entire life might face the most difficult written exam in his entire life. For the test focuses on a wide range of subject matters such as:</p><ul><li><p>Rights and Responsibilities of a Canadian Citizen</p></li><li><p>Canadian History</p></li><li><p>Canadian Political Systems</p></li><li><p>Canadian Physical and Political Geography</p></li></ul><p>Canadian roots and population will also be portrayed in the exam and the applicant must have an idea on how they value democracy, gender equality and human rights.</p><p>The exam is usually written, however in some cases, this test might be done in oral depending on the situation. The test is divided into different stages, from the history of the native people who first lived in Canada, the language that they use, their culture and the early form of their civilization. The first segment of the exam focuses more on the history of the first people in Canada and the language that they use although out the colonial period.</p><p>Taking up the exam means to study the entire history, demographics and geography of Canada. After finishing the first segment of the exam, it will be followed by a test on Modern Day Canada, Economy and Symbolism. This test shows you the actual scenario of what it means to become a real Canadian Citizen and embracing the history and rich culture of Canada.</p><p><strong>By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.</strong></p><p>There different institutions and online practices that you can find to sharpen your deep knowledge about the Canadian history, culture, roots and politics. Prepare yourself and begin to ready your history books and take up online courses for the exam only allows you have 5 wrong answer, answer all the questions and if you do not know the answer, a 25% chance of guessing the right answer might help you out. Read much and study harder before the exam but make sure not to put too much pressure on it. Get some rest and a decent sleep before the day of examination. Relax, read and understand the questions.</p><p><strong>After Passing the Exam</strong></p><p>If the applicant met the requirements of having a minimum of 15 correct answers and when the official has done verifying the authenticity of the applicant\u2019s documents. He/she will be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony within 4-6 months or might receive another questionnaire requesting more evidence of living in Canada.</p><p>After passing the exam, the citizenship authorities will provide the exact date and time of the citizenship ceremony, in the ceremony, the applicant will begin to take an Oath of Citizenship announcing that he is now legally and officially a Canadian citizen. After the Oathtaking, the applicant\u2019s citizenship certificate will be given.</p><p>Try not to worry more about the residency questionnaire, for it will only ask the applicant to provide more evidence of his living in Canada. Usually this is given to those who have traveled a lot outside Canada or those who have complexity in the application. Once the applicant receives this residency questionnaire, he will be invited for an interview once again with the citizenship officer and might ask for more supportive documents.</p><p><strong>A hope for those who failed the Citizenship Test</strong></p><p>If the applicant failed to pass exam but meet all the requirements to become a Canadian citizen, the Citizenship Officer will recommend the applicant to retake the exam or reschedule a second test. This could happen within 4-8 weeks after the commencement of the first one. The applicant must confirm his attendance for the second exam to the authorities immediately. During the second exam, the applicant will also receive the results on the same day. If the applicant, once again failed the exam he will be invited by a citizenship judge for an interview that usually takes 30-90 minutes. You will be asked a lot of questions orally on why you need to become a Canadian citizen. The judge would want to know the motives of your application and might ask the legitimacy of the time that you spent living in Canada. This interview will also test your English or French language skills as well as your knowledge about Canada.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3939426", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Management", "title": "Corporate Finance #3 Forecasting & Budgeting", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "509", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "75", "students": "26202", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3939426_e569.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-finance-3-forecasting-budgeting/?couponCode=6EDBDC0B95075C45D592", "end_day": "2022-04-24 06:02:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to forecast and budget from a certified public accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will cover the concepts of forecasting and budgeting from a finance perspective.</p><p>The course includes many example problems, both in presentation form, and many using Excel worksheets.

This is particularly important for samples that contain new or rare viruses for which diagnostic tests are not yet developed&nbsp; Many viruses can be grown in cell culture in the lab.</p><p>To do this, the virus sample is mixed with cells, a process called adsorption, after which the cells become infected and produce more copies of the virus&nbsp; &nbsp;Although different viruses often only grow in certain types of cells, there are cells that support the growth of a large variety of viruses and are a good starting point, for example, the African monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEp-2). One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome. Hence, it provides the most information about very small differences between two viruses that would look the same using other diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>Viral replication</strong> is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.&nbsp; Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.</p><p>Through the generation of abundant copies of its genome and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts. Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells.

The virus takes advantage of the existing cell structures to replicate itself</p><p><strong>synthesis of virus components</strong>[</p><p>The components are manufactured by the virus using the host's existing organelles:</p><p>\u2022Viral proteins: Viral mRNA is translated on cellular ribosomes into two types of viral protein:</p><p>\u2022Structural: proteins which make up the virus particle</p><p>\u2022Nonstructural: proteins not found in the virus particle, mainly enzymes for virus genome replication </p><p>Viral nucleic acid (genome replication): New viral genomes are synthesized; templates are either the parental genome or newly formed complementary strands, in the case of single-stranded genomes. These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

The test covers the following topics: patient safety and emergency situations, positioning the patient, use of restraints, learning the metric system, and preventing your own injuries. Each multiple-choice question has four answer options. Read the question and select the best answer. Not sure which one is right? Click on the hint. If you still make a mistake, you\u2019ll see the correct response displayed along with an explanation to help you understand. If you miss more than eight questions, you can restart the test and try again.</p><p><strong>What to expect on the CNA exam</strong></p><p>Your CNA exam will have two parts: the written exam (you\u2019ll have 90 minutes to complete 60 multiple choice questions) and the clinical skills test. The written part will test your knowledge of nursing concepts, while the clinical skills test requires you to perform several essential nursing tasks in front of an evaluator. The skills test portion is about 35-45 minutes and covers five or more skills.</p><p><strong>Alternate names:</strong></p><p>A CNA test is also known as:</p><ul><li><p>Certified Nursing Assistant examination</p></li><li><p>Nursing assistant test</p></li><li><p>CNA knowledge test</p></li><li><p>CNA exam</p></li><li><p>Nurse assistant test</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why CNAs are important</strong></p><p>Certified Nursing Assistants are vital members of the health care team. Your skills can keep your patients safe and comfortable. Your ability to provide hands-on care means that you may be the first to notice changes in your patients. You have a lot to learn, but we are here to help. Start with the basic skills. Nearly everything builds from there. As you learn, you will become a valuable team member. Remember that health care would not be possible without the CNA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CNA \u2013 A Certified Nursing Assistant</strong> is a nurse that helps patients with healthcare needs under the supervision of a <strong>Registered Nurse</strong> (RN) or a <strong>Licensed Practical Nurse</strong> (LPN). Also known as a <strong>Nursing Assistant</strong> (NA) a <strong>Patient Care Assistant</strong> (PCA) or a <strong>State Tested Nurse Aid</strong> (STNA), the individual who carries this title needs a strong work ethic and ability, but issues of liability and legality prevent CNA\u2019s from performing certain procedures.</p><p>We have the Best Free <strong>CNA Practice Test Online</strong>.<br>These are full-length practice exams with challenging questions.

Using sample questions to study for your test is the most effective study practice you can use. The advantages of using RMA sample tests include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increasing Your Speed</strong> \u2013 The RMA exam has a three hour time limit. Although most students who take the RMA feel that there is sufficient time, taking the practice tests with self-imposed timers help you budget your time effectively. You should budget approximately 1 minute for each question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Becoming comfortable with the Test Format</strong> \u2013 Every standardized test has its own unique format. As you take practice RMA tests you will become comfortable with the format of the actual test. Once the test day arrives you will have no surprises!</p></li><li><p><strong>Concentrating Your Prep Time</strong> \u2013 As you take more and more sample quizzes you begin to get a feel for the topics that you know well and the areas that you are weak on. Many students waste a lot of valuable study time by reviewing material that they are good at (often because it is easier or makes them feel better). The most effective way to study is to concentrate on the areas that you need help on.</p></li></ul><p>RMA EXAM OVERVIEW</p><p>The RMA certification exam consists of 200-210 questions that count towards your score. All of the questions will be multiple choice questions with four answer options.</p><p>Candidates are given a total of three hours to complete the test.

For applicants who met the admissions criteria and successfully submitted their application, the chance of acceptance was 70%.<br></p><p>The reasons for this high number of unsuccessful applications are mainly twofold. First, there weren\u2019t enough spaces, or funding, available for so many applicants, and second, despite meeting admission criteria, many applicants were beaten by others with better scores.<br></p><p>The good news is that the nursing sector is growing at a rate of 16%, which is quite fast, meaning that nearly half a million new jobs will exist by 2024. The other good news is that you can do a lot of preparation to boost your scores and increase your chances of being accepted into your preferred program.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do I beat the competition?</strong></p><p>Based on the data above, it it safe to assume that from the outset, your application has a 50% chance of being successful.

Becoming an Australian citizen means that you are making an ongoing commitment to Australia and all that this country stands for. It is<br>also the beginning of your formal membership of the Australian community. It is the step that will enable<br>you to say \u2018I am Australian\u2019.</p><p>How to get Australian Citizenship?</p><p>Australian citizenship is a privilege that offers enormous rewards. By becoming an Australian citizen, you are joining a unique national community. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from all over the world. We celebrate this diversity and at the same time, strive for a unified and harmonious nation. The strength of the Australian community means that we work together to solve problems and to make Australia the great country that it is. We have a stable system of government and Australians respect the authority and laws of the government. Our stability, our culture and our laws have been shaped by our history. By joining the Australian community, you will inherit this history and you will be in a position to contribute to it.</p><p>Australia is an ancient land. It is vast and unique. It is a country of rainforests and woodlands; of golden<br>beaches and dry deserts. Our Indigenous cultures are the oldest continuing cultures in the world. We are also a young nation; a nation of migrants. European settlement in Australia began in 1788 and we continue to welcome new migrants today. People from more than 200 countries have made Australia their home. As a result, our society is one of the most diverse in the world. Australia successfully combines ethnic and cultural diversity with national unity. Citizenship is the bond that unites us all.</p><p>On 17 September 2006 the Australian Government released a discussion paper seeking community views on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. More than 1644 responses were received with 60 per cent of respondents supporting the introduction of a citizenship test. A further 25 per cent of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a formal citizenship test and the remaining 15 per cent did not state a clear view either way.</p><p>On 11 December 2006 the Government announced its intention to introduce a citizenship test and values statements for permanent and selected temporary visa applicants.</p><p>The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2007 and was passed by the Parliament on 12 September 2007.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview.

Amazon offers the largest selection of products and some of the best commission rates for affiliates. It\u2019s also open to just about anyone in the world, regardless of your physical location. Another great feature of this business model, is that it\u2019s infinitely scalable. You can start by selling just a few products a week, and easily scale to selling thousands. Once your store is set up, it requires nearly no maintenance. If you\u2019re interested in building passive income streams, this is about as close as you\u2019ll get.</p><p>The course starts with an introduction into the benefits of joining the Amazon Affiliate network.

The steps of the closing process will be much the same as those for any business entity except for the allocation of net income to the partners. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will consider the situation where a partner leaves a partnership or where a new partner is added.

The liquidation process is a very useful exercise for any entity because it allows us to do take apart a business. We have discussed the process of putting new busses together in prior courses, but to fully understand how something works we must also take it apart. The liquidation process is particularly important for a partnership entity because it emphasizes the capital accounts and the process necessary to reduce the likelihood of problems during the process. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We also include a comprehensive problem designed to take a step back and consider all the similarities between business entities so that we can put the differences we have studied in this course into perspective.

Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.</p><p>Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.</p><p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p><p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3912180", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "App android y Sistema para Karaoke en Xamarin Forms", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Academia Apps", "duration": "1045", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "67", "students": "24480", "coupon_code": "APRIL2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3912180_30fd_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/app-android-y-sistema-para-karaoke-en-xamarin-forms/?couponCode=677E4E880F6C83B36C43", "end_day": "2022-04-23 14:46:00+00:00", "headline": "Proyecto funcional y terminado", "description": "<p>En este proyecto aprenderas a crear una Aplicacion movil para Karaokes y un Sistema de gestion del mismo.</p><ul><li><p>La aplicacion movil esta desarrollado Xamarin forms usando el lenguaje <strong>C</strong># y patron de software <strong>MVVM</strong></p></li><li><p>El sistema de gestion esta desarrollado en <strong>C# </strong>y base de datos S<strong>QLServer</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Los Temas a ver en la aplicacion movil son:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Modulo de pedidos</p></li><li><p>Modulo de introduccion</p></li><li><p>Animacion de degradados</p></li><li><p>Dise\u00f1os con degradados</p></li><li><p>Listview personalizados</p></li><li><p>Ventanas emergentes personalizados</p></li><li><p>Conexion a SQLServer</p></li><li><p>Creacion de Apk</p></li><li><p>Publicacion de la aplicacion en PlayStore</p></li><li><p>Patron de software MVVM</p></li><li><p>Lector de codigos QR</p></li><li><p>Escaneo de codigo QR para la conexion</p></li><li><p>Pedidos de canciones extras</p></li></ul><p><strong>Los temas a ver en sistema de gestion son:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Modulo de canciones</p></li><li><p>Modulo de pedidos</p></li><li><p>Modulo de mesas</p></li><li><p>Modulo de codigos QR</p></li><li><p>Asistente de instalacion automatizada</p></li><li><p>Creacion de ejecutables portables con base de datos Incluido</p></li><li><p>Dise\u00f1o de interfaces por codigo</p></li><li><p>Arquitectura de software en 3 capas</p></li><li><p>Conexiones encryptadas a SQLServer</p></li><li><p>Escaneo de codigo QR para la conexion</p></li></ul><p><strong>En el 2021</strong> xamarin esta siendo utilizado para aplicaciones robustas y funcionales.
