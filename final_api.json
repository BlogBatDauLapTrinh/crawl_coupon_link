You can also take <strong>quizzes</strong> to check your understanding of concepts like Business Statistics and Analytics in MS Excel. Each section contains a <strong>practice assignment</strong> for you to practically implement your learning on Business Analysis in MS Excel.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this course?</strong></p><p>The analysis of data is not the main crux of analytics. It is the interpretation that helps provide insights after the application of analytical techniques that makes analytics such an important discipline. We have used the most popular analytics software tool which is MS Excel. This will aid the students who have no prior coding background to learn and implement&nbsp; Statistics and Analytics concepts to actually solve real-world problems of Business Analysis.</p><p>Let me give you a brief overview of the course</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 1 - Excel for data analytics</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the first section, i.e. Excel for data analytics, we will learn how to use excel for data-related operations such as calculating, transforming, matching, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.</p><p>We will also cover how to use different types of charts to visualize the data and discover hidden data patterns.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 2 - Statistics foundations for business analysts</strong></p></li></ul><p>Then, in the second section, i.e. Statistics foundations for business analysts, we will start learning about the core concepts of Business Analytics i.e. probability and probability distribution. We will look at important probability distributions used in a business setting such as Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution, Binomial&nbsp; distribution etc</p><p>These concepts form the foundation of data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 3 -</strong> <strong>Statistical Decision making</strong></p></li></ul><p>Once we have covered the basics of probability, in the 3rd section, i.e. Statistical Decision making we will discuss some advanced concepts related to sample testing i.e. hypothesis testing.</p><p>These are the concepts that differentiate a beginner from a pro!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 4 - Optimizing Business Models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the fourth section, i.e. Optimizing Business Models we will learn how to solve common business problems with the help of excel's data analytics tools such as solver, goal seek, scenario manager, etc.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 5 - Preprocessing Data for ML models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn what actions you need to take step by step to get the data and then prepare it for analysis, these steps are very important. We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bivariate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 6 - Linear regression model for predicting metrics</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge on Business Statistics and Business Analysis using MS Excel, and the skillsets of a Business Analyst to immediately see practical benefits in your workplace.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this Statistics for Business Analytics
