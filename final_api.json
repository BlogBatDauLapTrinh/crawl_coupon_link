Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</p><p>Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a <em>pallavi</em>, an <em>anupallavi</em>, <em>muktaayi swaras</em>, a <em>charanam</em>, and <em>chittaswaras</em>. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).</p><p>Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.</p><p><strong>Types of varnams</strong></p><p>Named for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, <em>tana varnams</em> only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.</p><p>With rhythmic elements like a padam, <em>pada varnams</em> are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the <em>tana varnam</em> which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a <em>pada varnam</em> also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, <em>pada varnams</em> contain more lyrical content than a <em>tana varnam</em>.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.<em>Padajathi varnams</em> are simply <em>pada varnams</em> that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.</p><p><strong>Contents of a varnam</strong></p><p>The name \"varnam\" (meaning \"letter\") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.</p><p>Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.</p><p>The varnam is subdivided into several sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pallavi</strong>: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anupallavi</strong>: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muktaayi</strong>: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like <em>s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one</em>). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charanam</strong>: Sung with lyrics</p></li><li><p><strong>Chitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram</strong>: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anubandham</strong>: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.</p></li></ul><p>Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.</p><p>Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, <em>Adi Tala</em> (8 beat cycle) and <em>Ata Tala</em> (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the <em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice</p><p><strong>Famous varnams</strong></p><p><em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams include :</p><ul><li><p>\"Sami Ninne\" in <em>Shree ragam</em> composed by <em>Karur Devudu Iyer</em> in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Ninnukori\" in <em>Mohanam ragam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Evvari Bodhana\" in <em>Abhogi ragam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Era Naapai\" in <em>Todi raagam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Valachi Vacchi\" in <em>Navaraagamalika</em> in Telugu (9 ragas, similar to <em>Ragamalika</em> which literally translates to a <em>garland of ragams</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Ata Tala</em> Varnams include:</p><ul><li><p>\"Viriboni\" in <em>Bhairavi ragam</em> by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Nera Nammiti\" in <em>Kaanada raagam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Chalamela\" in <em>Sankarabharanam</em> by Swati Tirunal in Telugu</p></li></ul><p>The <em>Arabhi</em> ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.</p><p>The \"Mathe Malayadhwaja\" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancers</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-10-07_14-34-01-cb6fa294290f4137dc71c52dde409964/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637239074&Signature=jJnTk0WvoNcJ8ixymm9X-Tpq49Svimkwa-J7AI6EC8gRTkKzCLhCBSKu1Wzno2J0ME9OOOI6LrBuXleRtnvAVKCU5w7KiJo2irzK1MfZOa5ADit7WrTCYVBmQhpboxhl2lN0z4yqwJ1YUxKB56bHpaLCrhhyJtQU02NbZWNjaoQOVQc0XkdWPfDLEPOYVbB1~zLCLE5tTgyb8HFcXQmIVq0DrLnfg0OuWBlhvEWXXw2oaTNt0TlhrxKrmL5dDTnGpdkJ0WkWUX3fQXTZAsI0vxCVKQEAZ0CvpAl2H4i0XNEJdiL-kdjxW-ayUpSnQgz023t3Xk2pNmVDTp5iD64B5Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "1905626", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Transformation", "title": "Control Your Subconscious Mind: Neuroscience Hidden Secrets", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Dr. Vijender Goel", "duration": "2.5 hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "115", "students": "16156", "coupon_code": "NOV2021FREE01", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1905626_c5c0_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/master-your-brain-to-achieve-your-desired-success/?couponCode=NOV2021FREE01", "end_day": "2021-11-23 06:58:23+00:00", "headline": "The ULTIMATE Neuroscience Blueprint to UNLOCK and UTILIZE your subconscious mind.

Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform.

Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham ( ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc )</p><p>Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music.All varnams consist of lyrics,as well as swara passages, including a <em>pallavi</em>, an <em>anupallavi</em>, <em>muktaayi swaras</em>, a <em>charanam</em>, and <em>chittaswaras</em>. There are different types of varnams, such as taana varnam, pada varnam, daru varnam and ragamalika varnam. They also come different taalams (beat cycles). Though the most popular varnams are in Aadi and Ata taalas, there are a number of varnams in other talas as well (e.g., jampa tala, triputa tala, matya talam, roopaka talam, etc).</p><p>Considered as probably the most complex form in Carnatic music, varnams play a significant role in Carnatic music. A varnam is traditionally performed as an opening item by musicians in Carnatic music concerts to act as warm-up for the musicians,or as a centre main piece in Bharatanatyam dance concerts. As a foundation to Carnatic music,varnams are also practised as vocal exercises by performers of Carnatic music, to help develop voice culture, and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm. The melodic patterns in a varnam are considered to be characteristic patterns of a particular raga.</p><p><strong>Types of varnams</strong></p><p>Named for its tanam-like rhythmic qualities, <em>tana varnams</em> only have lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam.</p><p>With rhythmic elements like a padam, <em>pada varnams</em> are generally sung to accompany South Indian classical dance, including bharatanatyam.Unlike the <em>tana varnam</em> which only has lyrics for the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam and swaras for the rest of the sections a <em>pada varnam</em> also have lyrics that correspond to the muktaayi and chitta swaras of the varnam, so generally, <em>pada varnams</em> contain more lyrical content than a <em>tana varnam</em>.The swaras in this type of varnam are suitable for intricate footwork.<em>Padajathi varnams</em> are simply <em>pada varnams</em> that also contain jatis in it, making it again more suitable for South Indian classical dance.</p><p><strong>Contents of a varnam</strong></p><p>The name \"varnam\" (meaning \"letter\") was likely given to this form of song due to the prevalence of swara letters in this type of composition.</p><p>Lyrical content of varnams are commonly either devotional or amorous.</p><p>The varnam is subdivided into several sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pallavi</strong>: The first section of the Varnam, sung with lyrics or sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anupallavi</strong>: A sort of recapitulation, sung with lyrics or sahitya also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Muktaayi</strong>: Sung completely with syllables\u2014or swaras -- (like <em>s (sa) r (Ri) g(ga) m(ma) p (pa) d(da) n(ni) (sa)(This is the higher version of the normal one</em>). In Pada Varnas it is known as Muktaayi Swara-Sahitya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charanam</strong>: Sung with lyrics</p></li><li><p><strong>Chitta Swara or Ettugadda Swaram</strong>: Sung completely with syllables. In a Pada varnam, there are lyrics which correspond to the Charanam swaras. The swaras occur in several groups or stanzas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anubandham</strong>: epilogue to the Varnam. Some varnams have this additional part that follows the charanam and chitta(Ettugadda) swaras, that is sung with lyrics or sahitya thus leading back to the muktaayi(Chitta) swara or the first pallavi line itself. It is found more often with very old Varnams and it is less prevalent in the newer varnams. In modern times, some old varnams are even sung partially, by omitting the anubandham part. The most classical example of this is the Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi, which is sung after omitting one of its chitta swaras and the anubandham.</p></li></ul><p>Varnams are traditionally rendered in a format that consists of Pallavi, Anupallavi and Chitta Swaram (Mukthayi Swaram) being sung first in a relatively slow pace and repeated immediately after in double the speed. The rest of the composition (Charanam onwards) is sung in a 'madhyama kala' or approximately 1.5 times the speed used at the start. Each swara passage is sung, followed by the lyrics of the charanam. Some performers do not follow this though, preferring to sing the entire composition in 'madhyama kala' or relatively fast pace.</p><p>Varnams are generally sung in two varieties of talas, or metric systems, <em>Adi Tala</em> (8 beat cycle) and <em>Ata Tala</em> (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams are generally more complicated and advanced. In most of the <em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams the tala is placed in the 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice.</p><p><strong>Famous varnams</strong></p><p><em>Adi Tala</em> Varnams include :</p><ul><li><p>\"Sami Ninne\" in <em>Shree ragam</em> composed by <em>Karur Devudu Iyer</em> in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Ninnukori\" in <em>Mohanam ragam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Evvari Bodhana\" in <em>Abhogi ragam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Era Naapai\" in <em>Todi raagam</em> by Patnam Subramania Iyer in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Valachi Vacchi\" in <em>Navaraagamalika</em> in Telugu (9 ragas , similar to <em>Ragamalika</em> which literally translates to a <em>garland of ragams</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Ata Tala</em> Varnams include:</p><ul><li><p>\"Viriboni\" in <em>Bhairavi ragam</em> by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Nera Nammiti\" in <em>Kaanada raagam</em> by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Telugu</p></li><li><p>\"Chalamela\" in <em>Sankarabharanam</em> by Swati Tirunal in Telugu</p></li></ul><p>The <em>Arabhi</em> ragam varnam is supposed to be the only longest piece with jantai and dhattu prayogas.</p><p>The \"Mathe Malayadhwaja\" by Harikesanalloor Mutthiah Bhasgavatar is a unique Varnam because the Chitta swara has two different types of saahitya arranged according to it. The first is a rhythmic poetry describing the king and has the Raaja mudra and the second is a lilting Solkattu swara which is very nicely embodied in expression by bharatanatyam dancers</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-11-14_18-02-56-6c3a092d6cb8f40358dff15d5163f0ac/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637239149&Signature=Pw8Cukeh2WNjHkTueJi68QFNemt6wuatxI3wSgpcKaoXUTcMaA~8aG32Nmpb1HtdQa8pSWZIFNOMFMs99BXZ4-pCinNiJUtsUV0iqNylIIjeBlw26h1Y2YxF2ve2Y-QYzRutVeDNXmXgEAGKmcXT8Ce9H5eayopjrvLtePIhr4mquQdhysSHLjre4MadHi9QiFAKXdKS~TGd-i6fmUMSu8Z~PO7iS-3LEf5-hV67HGdXz~TZggN2dn9w-U2q2l1ERgX5lYfWnKZ4hOPCVUbjpm29PPyWkhwkl38SGEejxdI~7xzlp5tiVBWnKKNlhQVgb90H01YFUNqSMxnlMR4iQQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3833784", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Digital Marketing Strategy Bundle: 5 practical courses in 1!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Anton Voroniuk", "duration": "7.5 hours", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "1922", "students": "120746", "coupon_code": "DIGITALMARKETING1811", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3833784_12ca_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-marketing-strategy-from-scratch-course/?couponCode=DIGITALMARKETING1811", "end_day": "2021-11-23 04:52:40+00:00", "headline": "Grow your business with Digital Marketing Strategy, Content Marketing, SEO, Social Media Marketing, and Google Analytics", "description": "<p>Do you want to grow your business online?

We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.</p><p>The basics taught in this part will be fundamental in learning time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques on later part of this course.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Basics of Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, we will discuss about the basics of time series data, application of time series forecasting, and the standard process followed to build a forecasting model, time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Pre-processing Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn how to visualize time series, perform feature engineering, do re-sampling of data, and various other tools to analyze and prepare the data for models and execute time series forecasting, time series analysis and implement Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 5 -</strong> <strong>Getting Data Ready for Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment and missing value imputation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 6 - Forecasting using Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 7 - Theoretical Concepts</strong></p></li></ul><p>This part will give you a solid understanding of concepts involved in Neural Networks.</p><p>In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 8 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills related to time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques to immediately see practical benefits in your work place.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this course on time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques!</strong></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-03-12_13-39-50-cc4bf64c2dea96d9e7c5520dbc5a99dc/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637239165&Signature=VH0i7Jdbj9erZaBY-OB3VNKeDnDx-YPTcTlc553q4S9ecb4UfB-5d6CrjGwJs-jiGuyi6pU-msXC6lLjW7BlkC8-QxQs~u~kue8iY6Yz7fA8YYog~dLXf0ZfIefUmoaRA0ZTIw4c7m4dCveaqBi2jbq5oSM7TE6RODPd-bTpaGzWpR0KbVQX2rd62q~7qpY6fRSev28mdLBNVE8C8QTsMeva3YAGgYtHmLnATKxyZhtU8~gR6u5QHvotjfSmx7mc5mX5lSSq-u2WAJTgM2PeeMzp6ZxjswWoTsZtk7iWLR-AusQgoWspG-p0-emxFl4KZtPPrLkOXs1TGOhNxxUWQw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "2818343", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Practical Cisco Networking Labs in Cisco Packet Tracer", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Cyber Quince", "duration": "12 hours", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "1102", "students": "115466", "coupon_code": "NOV21FREEE", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2818343_f895.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-cisco-networking-labs/?couponCode=NOV21FREEE", "end_day": "2021-11-22 06:20:06+00:00", "headline": "Networking concepts explained in a simple way, with many engaging exercises!", "description": "<p>This course's goal is to teach you some of the most important computer networking concepts, but also provide practical, real-life scenario labs &amp; guide you through configuring those successfully.

If you're willing to learn and apply the knowledge I share with you,<em> I</em> can teach you the rest.</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm interested, so what will I learn exactly?</strong></p><p>First, you\u2019ll get a comprehensive, high quality video overview that will show you how to CREATE FACEBOOK ADS THAT DELIVER REAL RESULTS. I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover the customer journey to purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find your IDEAL customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to HONE IN ON YOUR PERFECT CUSTOMER. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be sharing POWERFUL INSIDER TARGETING STRATEGIES that will SUPERPOWER your custom and lookalike audience set up.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting the most out of the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and FAST.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events to take your Ad game to the next level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to GET MORE from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Facebook Ads Reporting and Attributions</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll show you how to use Facebook Reporting to create interactive weekly email reports on all your Facebook Ad campaigns.
