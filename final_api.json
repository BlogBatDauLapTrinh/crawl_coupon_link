Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Which all classification techniques are taught in this course?</strong></p><p>In this course we learn both parametric and non-parametric classification techniques. The primary focus will be on the following three techniques:</p><ol><li><p>Logistic Regression</p></li><li><p>Linear Discriminant Analysis</p></li><li><p>K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) </p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Classification techniques of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Classification is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn classification starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of classification.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of&nbsp; models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "1904376", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Other Office Productivity", "title": "Job Order Costing System \u2013 Managerial Accounting", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "699", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "75", "students": "27712", "coupon_code": "M02-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1904376_e96d_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/job-order-costing-system-managerial-accounting/?couponCode=D84E4B502664035C405D", "end_day": "2022-05-28 04:31:00+00:00", "headline": "Accounting for a job cost system presented by a practicing certified public accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>Job cost system \u2013 Managerial Accounting</p><p>We will start by introducing managerial accounting or cost accounting topics that apply to companies that manufacture using either a job cost system or a process cost system. </p><p>The course will describe classifications for costs and the importance of being able to classify costs in different ways. </p><p>We will list and describe an outline of the process costs go through as they flow through the accounting process in a manufacturing company. </p><p>The course will compare the two major systems used to track inventory costs in a manufacturing company, the job cost system, and the process costs system.

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3694082", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Mit Online Marketing Dein Business aufbauen ohne Vorwissen!", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Sebastian Gl\u00f6ckner", "duration": "1628", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "122", "students": "10662", "coupon_code": "M02-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3694082_8a4d_8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/digitales-marketing-online-marketing/?couponCode=4921222D9ABE186E17D2", "end_day": "2022-05-29 17:56:00+00:00", "headline": "Nutze Digitales Marketing und Online Marketing, um Deine Online Ums\u00e4tze zu vervielfachen - auch ganz ohne Vorwissen!", "description": "<p><em>Letzte Aktualisierung: 25.5.2022</em></p><p><strong>***&nbsp;DER KURS WIRD&nbsp;LAUFEND&nbsp;ERWEITERT -&gt; neue Inhalte&nbsp;jeden&nbsp;Monat! ***&nbsp; </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Digitales Marketing und insbesondere Online Marketing boomen seit einigen Jahren.</strong> </p><p>Es herrscht eine <strong>Goldgr\u00e4berstimmung</strong>, und genau JETZT hat es Sinn, sich mit Online Marketing auseinanderzusetzen - bevor es zu sp\u00e4t ist. </p><p>Besonders jetzt, im Jahr 2022 <strong>explodiert der Online Traffic und die Werbepreise gehen herunter</strong>.</p><p>Der Einzelhandel, Unternehmer und Selbst\u00e4ndige sind aufgrund der aktuellen Lage gezwungen, ihre Produkte immer mehr online zu verkaufen - <strong>und kaum jemand ist wirklich darauf vorbereitet.</strong></p><p>Das Rennen hat offiziell begonnen, und wer sich <strong>JETZT</strong> mit Online-Marketing besch\u00e4ftigt, hat noch eine Chance, vorne mit dabei zu sein.</p><p>Woran liegt das? </p><p>In den letzten 3-4 Jahren hat sich eine Art <em>Onlinemarketing-Hype</em> entwickelt mit internationalen und deutschen Experten, die sehr viel Ahnung haben von E-Mail-Marketing, Leads, Funneln, Conversions und so weiter.</p><p>Jedoch hat dieses Wissen bisher kaum den Sprung von den Online-Marketing-Experten (die bisher weitgehend unter sich bleiben und sich untereinander Coachings verkaufen) in die <em>echte Offline-Welt</em> geschafft.</p><p>Und genau das ist die Chance, JETZT mit Digitalem Marketing / Online-Marketing anzufangen. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lerne, die wichtigsten Grundlagen und Begriffe des Online Marketing - damit wirst Dir viele Verst\u00e4ndnisprobleme und \u00c4rger ersparen!</strong></p><p>Die folgenden Fragen werden Dir als Erstes im Kurs beantwortet:</p><ul><li><p>Was ist Digitales Marketing, und was ist Online Marketing?</p></li><li><p>Was bedeutet Lead und Leadmagnet?</p></li><li><p>Wie funktioniert ein Sales Funnel?</p></li><li><p>Was ist der Unterschied zwischen&nbsp;Zielgruppe und Kunden-Avatar? </p></li><li><p>Nach welchem Prinzip funktioniert Affiliate Marketing? </p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Danach werden wir die Ziele und das \"Why\" Deines Online-Business erarbeiten - damit wirst Du viel Zeit sparen, da Du danach in die RICHTIGE Richtung gehst.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Wir werden erarbeiten, was dein \"Warum\" ist (mit Hilfe eines PDF Worksheets zum Download)</p></li><li><p>Du wirst lernen, wie Du Deine Marke und Dein Business positionierst mit dem \"Positioning Statement\".</p></li><li><p>Du wirst den Zweck einer USP (Unique Selling Proposition) kennenlernen und eine USP f\u00fcr Dich im Kurs erstellen.</p></li><li><p>Au\u00dferdem wirst du verstehen, wie Du die Au\u00dfendarstellung Deiner Pers\u00f6nlichkeit \"formst\".</p></li><li><p>Wir werden herausarbeiten, wo Deine Zielgruppe sich aufh\u00e4lt.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Du wirst lernen, wie Du in Windeseile eine eigene Webseite f\u00fcr Dein Business erstellst - damit sicherst Du Dir einen professionellen Auftritt und bist nicht abh\u00e4ngig von teuren Agenturen.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Du wirst den Unterschied und sie Einsatzzwecke von WordPress, Wix, Leadpages und Click Funnels kennenlernen.</p></li><li><p>Wir werden gemeinsam im Kurs eine Domain aussuchen.</p></li><li><p>Du wirst sehen, wie wichtig die Wahl des Hosting Providers ist - und welchen Du nehmen musst (Geschwindigkeit!)</p></li><li><p>Ich zeige Dir den optimalen Page Builder (Webseiten Erstellung inkl.

What are the meanings or different terms associated with machine learning? You will see some examples so that you understand what machine learning actually is. It also contains steps involved in building a machine learning model, not just linear models, any machine learning model.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Section 4 - Data Preprocessing</strong></p><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then</p><p>prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation and correlation.</strong></p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Section 5 - Regression Model</strong></p><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures. We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.</p><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in R will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey- </p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the R environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in R</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture in R where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3432318", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Human Resources", "title": "Jetpack 1.0: Artificial Intelligence and Automation in HR", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "69", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "103", "students": "28907", "coupon_code": "M02-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3432318_5d1e_6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/jetpack-10-artificial-intelligence-and-automation-in-hr/?couponCode=E2C7956047E86FE8F281", "end_day": "2022-05-27 17:39:00+00:00", "headline": "An amazing online course focussed on Artificial Intelligence tech for HR's in 2022", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience \"</em><strong><em>Jetpack 1.0\".</em></strong></p><p>Today, we are seeing an increasing number of applications of AI-based solutions across fields like eCommerce Marketing, Personalised Recommendations, Targeted Marketing, Finance Industry, etc. Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;seemed to be a distant reality for the HR function, until today.

That\u2019s not true. The basics of SEO are actually quite simple. And with 58% of all web traffic coming from Google, it\u2019s certainly something worth learning about if you have a website. If you think the SEO fundamentals aren\u2019t enough to get you ranked, think again. Most people running websites have a very limited understanding of SEO, so knowing the fundamentals can certainly help you succeed.</p><p><strong>What are the Benefits of SEO?</strong></p><ul><li><p>SEO leads to more traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to consistent traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to \u2018free\u2019 traffic</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO Helps You to Rank Higher</strong></p><p>But you can\u2019t rank higher if Google doesn\u2019t even know your website exists in the first place. Getting your website indexed by search engines means you\u2019re in the race, not that you\u2019re likely to win. That\u2019s where SEO comes in. SEO is an ongoing process that, if done well, increases your chances of winning over time. It\u2019s much easier to do SEO well when your website is properly set up for SEO success.</p><p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business. And that content needs to reach audience members in a way that feels natural and organic versus being disruptive. Content marketing helps businesses do this, and it describes the process of attracting, engaging with, and delighting your target markets.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Has Become One of the Most In-demand Skills of 2022</strong></p><p>In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year. Why? Every business can benefit from someone who writes great copy. From startups to Fortune 500s and everything in between, copywriting can make or break the success of an organisation.</p><p>The truth of the matter is this; anyone can become a copywriter. You don\u2019t need a degree or specialised training to master this skill. So, whether you\u2019re looking to start a career as a freelance copywriter or just want to improve the copy for your own business, this guide will give you the blueprint for getting your feet wet with copywriting.</p><p>Copywriting is the art of writing text for marketing purposes. It\u2019s designed to sell your products or services while establishing a voice for your brand. The main intention of copywriting is to persuade people to take a particular action, whether it\u2019s purchasing, signing up for something, or any other type of conversion.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Comes in Many Different Forms: </strong></p><p>Advertisements, web pages, brochures, white papers, social media content, and company tag-lines would all fall into the copywriting category, and that\u2019s just barely scratching the surface.</p><p>But copywriting is much more than just words. Great copy tells a compelling story and represents your brand image. It pulls on the strings that trigger the decision-making process for whoever reads what you\u2019re writing. </p><p>Copywriting doesn\u2019t sell products or services; it sells emotion and lifestyle. According to Google Trends, the global interest in copywriting is currently at an all-time high, based on search data over the last ten years.</p><p><strong>When You Enrol, You Also Get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course materials and tuition worth at least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and free extra resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes - 308 Questions A, B, C, D &amp; 14 Assignments</p></li><li><p>Complete Overview of all 210&nbsp;Google SEO Ranking Factors</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money-back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today</p></li><li><p>PDF Digital Nomad Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Starter pack for digital nomads</p></li><li><p>PDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically</p></li><li><p>PDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients</p></li><li><p>PDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination</p></li><li><p>PDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling</p></li><li><p>PDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value</p></li></ul><p><strong>Start Your Journey to Google SEO &amp; Copywriting Today!</strong></p><p>Digital marketing can turn around your entire financial situation - <em>if </em>you know how to do it right.

We can construct an&nbsp;accounting system where we record every financial transaction using debits and credits in a general journal, posting each journal entry to the general ledger, making the trial balance form the general ledger, and the financial statements from the trial balance. The process of recording every transaction using debits and credits is the process we have used in the past.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>To reduce the amount of data input when using a manual system, we can group transactions by transaction type and create special journals to record them. An accounting system using special journals can reduce data input by limiting the amount data needed to be input for each transaction due to the format of the special journal. Special journals can also eliminate the need to post each transaction to the general ledger. Rather than posting each transaction to the general&nbsp;ledger special journals are added up at the end of the period and one transaction is then posted for the entire period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Special journals are typically used in a manual system but understanding them helps any system because it helps to see what components of an accounting system are necessary to all accounting systems, which components can be changed, and when changing the format of the system would be beneficial. Automated systems also often general useful reports in a similar format as the special journals.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable and accounts payable are necessary&nbsp;for any system where we make&nbsp;sales on account and purchases on account.

Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event.

These and other cognitive functions are performed by the vastly interconnected neural networks formed by the roughly 100 billion neurons of the brain. The precise patterns of connectivity among neurons within these networks determines their function, and through experience, these connectivity patterns change over time to enable acquisition of new skills. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of brain function is the ability to learn new cognitive skills, such as the ability to understand and speak a foreign language. During learning, connections between neurons change through a process known as synaptic plasticity, which plays a pivotal role in learning, While traditional learning brings about changes in neural networks through experience, synaptic plasticity can also be enhanced by activating neuromodulatory regions in the brain via peripheral neurostimulation. This program seeks to use peripheral neurostimulation to facilitate the release of neurotransmitters associated with components of learning, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, we can leverage endogenous neuronal circuitry to enhance learning by accelerating the tuning of neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.</p><p>Recent success with this approach has been demonstrated in clinical rehabilitation studies, utilizing peripheral neurostimulation delivered through implanted electrodes.

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \"supported for critical security issues only.\" Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beginner Friendliness</strong></p><p><strong>Easy to Get Started With</strong></p><p>PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don't understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.</p><p>The latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well.

As we focus on the differences, we always want to keep in mind the similarities in accounting for different business entities. Most of what we have learned about the double entry accounting system and day to day accounting transactions in prior courses will remain the same. We are concentrating on the areas that will different because the differences are where the new information lies. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will start by defining what a partnership is and comparing the characteristics of a partnership with other business entities. Understanding one business entity and its components are often best learned by contrasting them with the attributes of others, always considering the relative pros and cons, thinking of situations and circumstances that would benefit one form of business entity over another. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will discuss the process for setting up a new partnership, typically starting with the partners contributing capital to the partnership, requiring us to record the contribution and the capital accounts. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will discuss the allocation of net income to the partners, one of the primary differences between a partnership type of entity and other types of entities. There is a lot of flexibility for net income allocation in a partnership, and this is one of its primary benefits. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will cover the recording of partnership draws, how to record them, as well as the closing process for a partnership. The steps of the closing process will be much the same as those for any business entity except for the allocation of net income to the partners. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will consider the situation where a partner leaves a partnership or where a new partner is added. The transactions related to a partner leaving or being added is unique to a partnership entity. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The course will cover a partnership liquidation process or closing process. The liquidation process is a very useful exercise for any entity because it allows us to do take apart a business.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"price": "0.0", "course_id": "3904774", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Human Resources", "title": "Diversity At Workplace", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nevcihan Dogan", "duration": "32", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "280", "students": "34478", "coupon_code": "M02-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3904774_476b.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/diversity-at-workplace-t/?couponCode=MAY.22", "end_day": "2022-05-27 07:43:00+00:00", "headline": "If you want to position your business for success, hire a diverse workforce.", "description": "<p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> is vital for employees because it manifests itself in building a great reputation for the company, leading to increased profitability and opportunities for workers.</p><p>Workplace diversity is important within the organization as well as outside.</p><p><strong>Diversity in the workplace</strong> means that a company\u2019s workforce includes people of varying gender, age, religion, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, languages, education, abilities, etc.</p><p><strong>Why is workplace diversity so important?</strong></p><p>In the modern, globally connected society and market, workplace diversity is becoming a <strong>necessity </strong>rather than a banner companies wave to show their commitment to embracing differences.</p><p>Most of the modern companies can sell their products <strong>all over the world</strong>, reaching many different groups of people.

You will be able to write <strong>automated tests, fixtures, built-in plugins and installable libraries. </strong></p><p><strong>Pytest is a Python based tool</strong></p><p>The use of Python is increasing not only in software development, but also in areas such as data analysis, research, test and other fields. Python's growth in many critical fields also comes with the desire for them to be placed correctly, effectively and efficiently, software testing is available to make sure that the programs function properly and provide accurate results. Additionally, more and more software projects involve continuous integration and include an automated testing phase as release cycles get shorter and manual in-depth testing of increasingly complex projects is simply impossible. Teams need to be able to trust testing from continuous integration servers to tell them if they can trust their software enough.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Pytest?</strong></p><p>PyTest is a robust Python testing tool that is used in all levels of software testing. PyTest is a key component in the work of many software development teams, quality assurance teams, independent testing companies and from students on their university projects. Many platforms are now switching from the legacy unitest to Pytest to test their code. This is because Pytest offers powerful features such as rewrite validation, a third-party attachment model, and a powerful yet simple device adaptation this is unmatched in any other testing framework. Pytest is a software testing framework, which means that Pytest is a command line tool that automatically finds tests you've written, runs tests, and reports results. It has a library of extras that you can use in your tests to help you test more effectively. Can be extended to writing plug-ins or installing third-party plug-ins. Can be used to test Python distributions.

Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey.
