Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. </p><p>Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. </p><p>In this introduction to computer programming course, you\u2019ll learn and practice key computer science concepts. You\u2019ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you\u2019ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own programs.</p><p>This Computer science and programming using python course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.</p><p>Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece. And those steps can be executed by a computer.</p><p>In this course, we will not get into everything that you need to be a programmer, but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be <strong>fluently</strong> programming in Python and you'll be so good at Python that you can get a job or use the language professionally.</p><p>You'll cover all that you need to be an accomplished Python Programmer.

We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. <br><br>The term \u201cScalable Cloud Computing\u201d has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.<br><br>To illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201cInstance\u201d we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.<strong> </strong>This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. <br><br>Similar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,<strong> </strong>virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.<strong> </strong>These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.<br><br>The level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.<br><br>Beyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).</p><p>In addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Exploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Types</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users for EC2</p></li><li><p>Deploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs</p></li><li><p>Assigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Administration </p></li><li><p>Creating Security Groups for Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>Remote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY&nbsp;for Windows.</p></li><li><p>Using EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances. </p></li></ul><p>If you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4417220", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "TypeScript Basic: Type System, Interfaces, Types, Generics", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Nick Masters", "duration": "119", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "12", "students": "3163", "coupon_code": "D2A49D96DD19A55F5D08", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4417220_016d_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-in-a-nutshell/?couponCode=D2A49D96DD19A55F5D08", "end_day": "2022-05-04 08:11:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn basic of Typescript, Run Typescript + Webpack and Babel in 2 hour", "description": "<p><strong>TypeScript</strong> is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

Fue primeramente introducida por la NASA en 1960 como una posible medida para detectar vida en otros planetas y como medida preventiva de contaminaci\u00f3n en el agua reciclada durante largos viajes al espacio. La Bioluminiscencia es un fen\u00f3meno natural que ocurre en muchas algas y bacterias acu\u00e1ticas, as\u00ed como en la luz producida por las luci\u00e9rnagas que se tom\u00f3 como base para evolucionar esta tecnolog\u00eda. El Adenosin Trifosfato (ATP) es un compuesto presente en todos los seres vivos, animales y plantas, incluyendo gran n\u00famero de alimentos y residuos de alimentos, bacterias, hongos y otros microorganismos. La cantidad de ATP puede ser usada como indicador de higiene proporcionando as\u00ed una medida de su estado de limpieza y de la eficiencia de los procesos de limpieza, detergentes y desinfectantes.</p><p>Pero aunque la t\u00e9cnica de Bioluminiscencia permite verificar el estado higi\u00e9nico sanitario en forma instant\u00e1nea, no excluye que se deben realizar siembras microbiol\u00f3gicas de acuerdo a los planes de seguimiento establecidos</p><p>Las luci\u00e9rnagas nos permiten comprender el fen\u00f3meno de bioluminiscencia, es decir, la emisi\u00f3n de luz fr\u00eda por organismos vivos.

La reacci\u00f3n se da cuando la luciferina, mol\u00e9cula responsable de la emisi\u00f3n de luz, es transformada en oxiluciferina por una enzima llamada luciferasa. La luciferasa consume ox\u00edgeno y una mol\u00e9cula de ATP, principal fuente de energ\u00eda de los seres vivos, para liberar luz a 560 nan\u00f3metros (nm).

In this complete video guide, you\u2019ll learn everything you need to know to get started building great links - the type that actually help to boost your SEO.</p><p>We\u2019ll teach you the techniques you need to know to avoid getting penalised by Google, and what Google looks for when it ranks your link. You\u2019ll learn why Site Relevance, Page Authority, and Domain Authority are important when it comes to the sites your links appear on and you\u2019ll understand what makes up a link and how search engines interpret this.</p><p><strong>One of the most important things we\u2019ll teach you is the right strategies to get more links - right now.</strong> You can\u2019t just do the same old things you might have done a few years ago, link building has changed, and, in this guide, you\u2019ll find the latest strategies to help you succeed with link building.</p><p>We\u2019ve covered ALL the essentials, from the right way to approach guest blogging to how to perform successful link-building outreach, so you can get those all-important links on high authority relevant sites.</p><p>After watching this course, as long as you\u2019re prepared to put in just a little effort, you\u2019ll soon be able to acquire useful links that will give your search ranking a huge boost.</p><p><strong>We are confident you can succeed with link building, if you want to</strong> - and this guide will ensure you\u2019ll have all the tools you need to form a link-building strategy that will help you achieve great results.</p><p><strong>What is Link Building?</strong></p><p><strong>The No 1 goal of link building is to boost your search engine visibility by getting links to your website on as many high-quality sites as possible.</strong> </p><p>There are numerous strategies you can use to achieve this, from the simple to the complex, including Content Marketing, Blogger Outreach, Resource Page linking, and PR.</p><p>Google used to use Page Rank to determine a page\u2019s quality, which was partly based on how many people were linking to it. But when people found out how to game Page Rank, Google lost the ability to detect what was a good link and a bad one, which reduced their ranking algorithms effectiveness.</p><p>In 2012 Google made some crucial updates, to weed out shady black hat link building techniques and better determine quality links. They now place a lot of importance on link quality, as well as quantity, meaning where your link appears is just as crucial, if not more, as how many links you get.</p><p>Now Google regularly penalizes websites who use black hat techniques or over-optimise with low-quality link building. The value of certain techniques such as submitting your site to web directories has also fallen, due to being repeatedly overused.</p><p>Search engines use backlinks to find out about new web pages, which they then include in search results. They also use them to evaluate a page\u2019s ranking position within search results.</p><p>Even though there have been a lot of changes, links are still critical if you want to rank well on Google. But employing low-quality link building techniques is not only a waste of your time and effort - but it could also actively damage your website\u2019s ranking.</p><p>The bottom line is backlinks are still so vital to your visibility in search, they are Google\u2019s key ranking signal. It\u2019s <em>pivotal</em> to learn the most current white hat techniques that will help you acquire great backlinks, so keep watching as we show you what to avoid, and what to do in order to build high quality backlinks this year.</p><p><strong>What can Link Building do for you?</strong></p><p>Link building is important if you\u2019re looking to build relationships with people in your industry for two primary reasons.</p><ol><li><p>It can help you acquire valuable backlinks on highly relevant, popular sites, but it also aids you in making connections over the long term. When you contact an influencer, site owner, or blogger with a well-written pitch that demonstrates the value of linking to you, you make that all-important first contact with someone who can be incredibly influential in your niche.</p></li><li><p>Even if they don\u2019t say yes, the first time around, providing your pitch is polite and relevant, you\u2019ll have made that all-important first contact. Next time, they might well say yes, or they might even come to you.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Get the RIGHT kind of traffic</strong></p><p>Links are incredibly useful for boosting your referral traffic and if you get a backlink on a popular website in your niche, you\u2019ll likely see a significant increase in visitors. As the traffic will already be pre-screened for interest, if your link appears on a relevant site, rather than a more general one - it\u2019s more likely to convert.</p><p>Getting your content, products, or services in front of people who are interested is a superb way to up the value of your links. Even if they don\u2019t buy from you right away, you\u2019ve raised your profile to an ideal target audience. This is something you should always be looking to do if your goal is to boost your SEO and expand your business.</p><p><strong>Establish your brand authority</strong></p><p>Your link building strategy can also help solidify your brand authority, particularly if you create content that\u2019s relevant to what you offer, and valuable to potential customers.</p><p>If you have a sportswear e-commerce store for example and published a piece entitled <em>\u201cGo from couch potato to 10K runner in 6 months\u201d</em>, this would be extremely relevant to a significant portion of your audience.</p><p>There\u2019s three ways you can benefit here.</p><ol><li><p>First, you\u2019re attracting people to your brand, who\u2019ve searched for the terms your piece has ranked for. Now they know who you are and are more likely to consider you an authority on a subject they are interested in.</p></li><li><p>Secondly, you\u2019ll raise your site authority with Google if enough people link to your piece, which also helps to boost your search engine ranking.</p></li><li><p>Thirdly, you may make some sales, if you link smartly to your products in the piece, or at the end, or if you include offers placed well around your article.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What\u2019s a hyperlink made of?</strong></p><p>To comprehend properly how links work and how search engines read them, you first need to understand all the different parts of a hyperlink - and what function they play.</p><p><strong>There are four main parts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Anchor tag</p></li><li><p>Href</p></li><li><p>Anchor text</p></li><li><p>Tag closure</p></li></ul><p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at what these different parts do\u2026</p><p><strong>Anchor tag </strong>- This is the part of your link that opens your link tag and lets search engines know a link is included.</p><p><strong>Href</strong> - Href is short for hyperlink referral and is the text inside the quote marks that shows where your URL is pointed to. It basically tells your browser where it needs to head to, whether that\u2019s a web page, image, or a file.</p><p><strong>Anchor text</strong> - This is the visible text that people click on when they open your link. It\u2019s often formatted differently from the rest of the text surrounding it, typically with an underline or blue colour to show it has been clickable.</p><p><strong>Tag closure</strong> - This one\u2019s pretty straightforward, it\u2019s the part of your link that lets the search engines know it\u2019s now the end of your tag.</p><p><strong>How to get Links Google LOVES</strong></p><p>Your focus should be on acquiring links that will have a positive impact on your Google rank, and often the best kinds of links are the ones you never even asked for.</p><p>You get these types of links by consistently creating something of quality, whether that\u2019s informative content, a unique website, or a really great product or service. When you do this regularly, people notice - and they naturally want to link to you.</p><p>Though you should <em>always </em>be trying to achieve these kinds of organic links, you shouldn\u2019t sit around waiting for people to link to your site. Instead, actively help to raise more awareness of your brand and content by using a link building strategy that boosts your Google rankings.</p><p>While not all Google ranking factors are known, there are many which most experts agree have a definite impact on your search position. Start watching as we\u2019re about to reveal the most important Google ranking factors you need to be aware of when it comes to link building.</p><p><strong>We really hope you will love learning all about backlinks and how to build them!</strong></p><p>Ing.

Architecture principles and clean code design in OOP applications", "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>GoF Design Patterns with detailed Java examples.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course!

This is particularly important for samples that contain new or rare viruses for which diagnostic tests are not yet developed&nbsp; Many viruses can be grown in cell culture in the lab.</p><p>To do this, the virus sample is mixed with cells, a process called adsorption, after which the cells become infected and produce more copies of the virus&nbsp; &nbsp;Although different viruses often only grow in certain types of cells, there are cells that support the growth of a large variety of viruses and are a good starting point, for example, the African monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEp-2). One means of determining whether the cells are successfully&nbsp; replicating the virus is to check for a change in cell morphology or for the presence of cell death using a microscope&nbsp; Other viruses may require alternative methods for growth such as the inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs</p><p> (e.g. avian influenza viruses</p><p>[4]) or the intracranial inoculation of virus using newborn mice (e.g. lyssaviruses</p><p>[Nucleic acid based methods</p><p>Molecular techniques are the most specific and sensitive diagnostic tests</p><p>They are capable of detecting either the whole viral genome or parts of the viral genome.</p><p>In the past nucleic acid tests have mainly been used as a secondary test to confirm positive serological results However, as they become cheaper and more automated, they are increasingly becoming the primary tool for diagnostics&nbsp; <strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong>[</p><p>Detection of viral RNA and DNA genomes can be performed using polymerase chain reaction. This technique makes many copies of the virus genome using virus-specific probes. Variations of PCR such as nested reverse transcriptase PCR and real time PCR can also be used to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases. <strong>Sequencing</strong>[</p><p><em>Main article: Whole genome sequencing</em></p><p>Sequencing is the only diagnostic method that will provide the full sequence of a virus genome. Hence, it provides the most information about very small differences between two viruses that would look the same using other diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>Viral replication</strong> is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.&nbsp; Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.</p><p>Through the generation of abundant copies of its genome and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts. Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm. viruses multiply only in living cells. The host cell must provide the energy and synthetic machinery and the low- molecular-weight precursors for the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acids </p><p>virus&nbsp; life cycle </p><p>1.Attachment</p><p>2.Entry,</p><p>3.Uncoating,</p><p>4.Transcription / mRNA production,</p><p>5.Synthesis of virus components,</p><p>6.Virion assembly and</p><p>Viral replication of a bacteriophage[3]</p><p>7- Release (Liberation Stage).</p><p><strong>Attachment It</strong> is the first step of viral replication. The virus attaches to the cell membrane of the host cell. It then injects its DNA or RNA into the host to initiate infection..</p><p>In animal cells these viruses get into the cell through the process of endocytosis which works through fusing of the virus and fusing of the viral envelope with the cell membrane of the animal cell</p><p> <strong>Entry</strong>[</p><p>The cell membrane of the host cell invaginates the virus particle, enclosing it in a pinocytotic vacuole. This protects the cell from antibodies like in the case of the HIV virus.</p><p><strong>Uncoating&nbsp; Uncoating</strong></p><p>Cell enzymes</p><p>(from lysosomes) strip off the virus protein coat. This releases or renders accessible the virus nucleic acid or genome&nbsp; <strong>Transcription / mRNA production</strong>[]</p><p>For some RNA viruses, the infecting RNA produces messenger RNA (mRNA), which can translate the genome into protein products </p><p>For viruses with negative stranded RNA, or DNA, viruses are produced by transcription then translation.</p><p>The mRNA is used to instruct the host cell to make virus components. The virus takes advantage of the existing cell structures to replicate itself</p><p><strong>synthesis of virus components</strong>[</p><p>The components are manufactured by the virus using the host's existing organelles:</p><p>\u2022Viral proteins: Viral mRNA is translated on cellular ribosomes into two types of viral protein:</p><p>\u2022Structural: proteins which make up the virus particle</p><p>\u2022Nonstructural: proteins not found in the virus particle, mainly enzymes for virus genome replication </p><p>Viral nucleic acid (genome replication): New viral genomes are synthesized; templates are either the parental genome or newly formed complementary strands, in the case of single-stranded genomes. These genomes are made by either a viral polymerase or (in some DNA viruses) a cellular enzyme, particularly in rapidly dividing cells</p><p><strong>Virion assembly </strong>A virion is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome (nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.</p><p>This may take place in the cell's nucleus, cytoplasm, or at plasma membrane for most developed viruses.</p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage</strong></p><p><strong>Release (liberation stage)</strong> The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion (force out) of enveloped viruses through the cell membrane.</p><p>The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain dormant in the cell.</p><p>In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis. Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, devised a system called the Baltimore Classification System to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII). The seven classes of <strong>Class 1: Double-stranded DNA viruses </strong>This type of virus usually must enter the host nucleus before it is able to replicate. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. </p><p><strong>class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses</strong></p><p>Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates. Two examples include the Circoviridae&nbsp; and Parvoviridae. They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication</p><p> <strong>Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses</strong></p><p>. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is monocistronic and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation <strong>Class</strong></p><p><strong> 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - positive-sense</strong></p><p>The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as <strong>positive-sense</strong> can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. </p><p>can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:</p><p>\u2022Viruses with polycistronic mRNA where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a polyprotein product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, reducing the size of its genome.</p><p>\u2022Viruses with complex transcription,</p><p>\u2022 for which sub genomic mRNAs,</p><p>\u2022 ribosomal frameshifting and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.</p><p><strong>Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate</strong></p><p>A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the retroviruses. One defining feature is the use of reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using integrase. Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases </p><p><strong>class 7: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate </strong>This small group of viruses, exemplified by the Hepatitis B virus, have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle&nbsp; (ccc DNA) that serves as a template for production of viral mRNAs and a sub genomic RNA. The progenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase and for production of the DNA genome.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "2043766", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Testing", "title": "Aprenda testes de integra\u00e7\u00e3o com Spring Boot", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Yuri Adeodato", "duration": "114", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "619", "students": "3795", "coupon_code": "FREEAPR22", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/2043766_7601_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/testes-de-integracao-com-spring-boot/?couponCode=FREEAPR22", "end_day": "2022-04-07 06:25:00+00:00", "headline": "Crie testes de integra\u00e7\u00e3o com Spring Boot atrav\u00e9s de exemplos pr\u00e1ticos.", "description": "<p><strong>Sobre o curso</strong></p><p>O mercado de trabalho est\u00e1, a cada dia, demandando mais profissionais que conhe\u00e7am sobre qualidade de software.

For example, the ignition system was only responsible for supplying the voltage needed to fire the spark plugs. Ignition timing was controlled by vacuum and mechanical advance systems. Today there are very few electrical systems that are still independent. Today, most manufacturers network their electrical systems together through computers. This means that information gathered by one system can be used by another. The result may be that a faulty component may cause several symptoms. Consider the following example. The wiper system can interact with the headlight system to turn on the headlights whenever the wipers are turned on. The wipers can interact with the vehicle speed sensor to provide for speed-sensitive wiper operation. The speed sensor may provide information to the antilock brake module. The antilock brake module can then share this information with the transmission control module, and the instrument cluster can receive vehicle speed information to operate the speedometer. If the vehicle speed sensor should fail, this could result in antilock brake operation and a warning light turned on in the dash. But it could also result in the speedometer not functioning, the transmission not shifting, and the wipers not operating properly.</p><p>The computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data and are capable of operating other devices. The use of computers on automobiles has expanded to include control and operation of several functions, including climate control, lighting circuits, cruise control, antilock braking, electronic suspension systems, and electronic shift transmissions. Some of these are functions of what is known as a body control module (BCM). Some body computer-controlled systems include direction lights, rear window defogger, illuminated entry, intermittent wipers, and other systems that were once thought of as basic. A computer processes the physical conditions that represent information (data). The operation of the computer is divided into four basic functions:</p><p>1. Input.</p><p>2. Processing.</p><p>3. Storage.</p><p>4. Output.</p><p>Vehicle Communication NetworksMost manufacturers now use a system of vehicle communications called multiplexing(MUX) to allow control modules to share information. Multiplexing provides the ability to use a single circuit to distribute and share data between several control modules throughout the vehicle. Because the data is transmitted through a single circuit, bulky wiring harnesses are eliminated. Vehicle manufacturers will use multiplexing systems to enable different control modules to share information. A MUX wiring system uses bus data links that connect each module. The term bus refers to the transporting of data from one module to another. Each module can transmit and receive digital codes over the bus data links. The signal sent from a sensor can go to any one of the modules and can be shared by the other modules. Electronic Accessory systems with the growing use of computers, most systems can be controlled electronically. This provides for improved monitoring of the systems for proper operation and the ability to detect if a fault occurs. Electronic Cruise Control Systems. Cruise control is a system that allows the vehicle to maintain a preset speed with the driver\u2019s foot off of the accelerator. Most cruise control systems are a combination of electrical and mechanical components. Memory Seats. The memory seat feature allows the driver to program different seat positions that can be recalled at the push of a button. The memory seat feature is an addition to the basic power seat system. Most memory seat systems share the same basic operating principles, the difference being in programming methods and the number of positions that can be programmed. Most systems provide for two-seat positions to be stored in memory. An easy exit feature may be an additional function of the memory seat that provides for easier entrance and exit of the vehicle by moving the seat all the way back and down. Some systems also move the steering wheel up and to full retract. Electronic Sunroofs. Some manufacturers have introduced electronic control of their electric sunroofs. These systems incorporate a pair of relay circuits and a timer function into the control module. Motor rotation is controlled by relays that are activated according to signals received from the slide, tilt, and limit switches.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4623732", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Ultimate CCNA 200-301: Practice Exams 2022 [New]", "level": "All Levels", "author": "It Exam Academy", "duration": "0", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "851", "coupon_code": "345E7993A9313A94E145", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4623732_6ab6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-ccna-200-301-practice-exams-2022-new/?couponCode=345E7993A9313A94E145", "end_day": "2022-04-06 21:21:00+00:00", "headline": "[New] Ultimate CCNA 200-301: Practice Exams 2022 With Explanations", "description": "<p><strong>Description</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ultimate CCNA 200-301: Practice Exams [2022] With Explanations</strong></p><p><strong>Ultimate CCNA 200-301 Practice Exams [Learn &amp; Practice] 2022 </strong></p><p><br></p><p>These practice tests cover the CCNA 200-301 syllabus questions and you will<strong> get confidence for passing the CCNA 200-301 Cisco Exam</strong>.

Remark, who found the fungal nature of favus in 1837 Berg who reported oral candidiasis in 1841 Wilkinson, who described vaginal candidiasis in 1849. Tinea versicolor was described clinically in 1846 by Eichstaedt, and its etiologic agent was identified in 1853. Beigel reported white Piedra in 1856 Piedra, which means \"stone\" in Spanish, is an asymptomatic superficial fungal infection of the hair shaft.

Destruction of food, lumber, paper, and cloth. 2. Animal and human diseases, including allergies . 3. Toxins produced by poisonous mushrooms and within food (Mycelium and Mycotoxicosis) . 4. Plant diseases. 5. Spoilage of agriculture produce such as vegetables and cereals in the godown. 6. Damage the products such as magnetic tapes and disks, glass lenses, marble statues, bones and wax. Beneficial Effects of Fungi: 1. Decomposition - nutrient and carbon recycling . 2. Biosynthetic factories. The fermentation property is used for the industrial production of alcohols, fats, citric, oxalic and gluconic acids. 3. Important sources of antibiotics, such as Penicillin. 4. Model organisms for biochemical and genetic studies. Eg: Neurospora crassa 5. Saccharomyces cerviciae is extensively used in recombinant DNA technology, which includes the Hepatitis B Vaccine . 6. Some fungi are edible (mushrooms). 7. Yeasts provide nutritional supplements such as vitamins and cofactors. 8. Penicillium is used to flavour Roquefort and Camembert cheeses. 9. Ergot produced by Claviceps purpurea contains medically important alkaloids that help in inducing uterine contractions, controlling bleeding and treating migraine. 10. Fungi (Leptolegnia caudate and Aphanomyces laevis) are used to trap mosquito larvae in paddy fields and thus help in malaria control.</p><p> Notice Fungi are eukaryote they have true nuclei surrounded by nuclear membrane and have rigid cell wall like plant they are larger than prokaryote with typically filamentous growth the majority are aerobes they require oxygen at some stage of their growth </p><p>Fungi live every where and have very diverse habitat most fungi are saprophytes and found on vegetation decomposing organic matter soil and waters some are parasite on plants animals and insects Many fungi can produce mycotoxin in food and in animal feeds which can cause toxicosis some used in food industries saccharomyces used in alcoholic drink yoghurt bread penicillium Roquefort which is used in producing cheese many used in vitamins production penicillium chryogenium used in producing pencillin G some are obligate aerobes others facultative aerobes and can ferment sugar and grow anaerobically fungi are organotrophs require organic source of carbon fungi are slow grower in comparison to many bacteria and resistant to antibiotics </p><p>Fungi grow in two morphologic forms yeasts or molds Yeast form yeasts grow mainly by budding producing spherical to ellipsoidal cells 3-15 micron in diameter either single or attached to each other forming pseudo hyphae they never produce aerial hyphae this is reflected on morphology of colonies on agar media which resemble bacterial growth the colony are pasty opaque and may be white creamy yellowish red or even black in color the yeast color generally attain a diameter of 0.5- -3 mm within 3 days the mould form the mould grow through the development of tube like extension forming what is known as hypha the mass of interwind hyphae is called mycelium the hypha may be divided into individual cells by septa which is cross walled that present one or two pores The hypha may present no septa and remain as continuous tube apportion of mycelium grows into the medium called vegetative mycelium visible part grow above the medium called aerial mycelium The aerial mycelium gives the colony fluffy appearance and bear the reproductive structures which give the colony its color The mold colony varies in its appearance size from few mm to few cm so the single colony may cover all the surface of the plate it may be Glabrous verrucose fluffy surface texture may be velvety cottony powdery may assume any color or grade of color known in nature Some molds have the character of dimorphism dimorphic moulds as they can grow also in a yeast form it takes place in tissue when the mold invade tissues it change to yeast form or In lab when the colony plated on enriched media such as brain heart infusion agar and incubated at 37c The rigid cell wall of fungi consisted of chitinous microfibrils embedded in a matrix of small polysaccharides protein lipids the major polysaccharide cell wall matrix consisted of glucan, manans, chitosan and galactan Yeasts have soluble peptidomanans as component of their outer cell wall the outer cell wall of dermatophytes contains glycopeptides that may evoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity The plasma membrane is similar to the mammalian plasma membrane differ it has the non polar ergosterol instead of cholesterol as a principal sterol this is the site of action of antifungal Fungal nuclei are variable in size and shape and numbers the DNA and associated protein occur as long filaments of chromatin which condense during nuclear division the number of chromosomes varies with particular fungus the fungal cell may contain up to 100 mitochondria </p><p> Growth of fungi fungi need for their growth a source of carbon e.g sugar a source of nitrogen e.g peptone inorganic compound as ammonium nitrate and source of inorganic nutrients potassium phosphorous magnesium Water is an absolute requirement for fungi fungi are more tolerant for water stress than other organisms but in draught no growth occur spore can survive in a suitable medium the fungal spores germinate forming germ tubes which develop into hyphae Growth temperature of fungi mesophilic between 10- 40C optimum temperature 25-35C some fungi grow best at 37 C Thermophilic or Thermotolerant they grow at temperature between 20-and 60 C with optimum of 40C Psychrophilic fungi grow at low temperature that reach to-20 as molds which grow on frozen meat e.g. Cladosporium The optimum PH of fungi is in the range 56-6.5 while few fungi grow below ph3 or aboveph9 several acidophilic fungi grow at pH 2 e.g. Aspergillus and penicillium few fungi are basophilic can grow at 10-11 e.g. fusarium exosporium&nbsp;

It is believed to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. rabic, which first emerged in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, is a member of the Semitic family of languages which also includes Hebrew and Aramaic. Whilst very early manifestations of Arabic date back <strong>as far as the 8th century BCE</strong>, the language has been defined and refined over a considerable period of time.Arabic is at least 1,500 years old. Classical Arabic originated in the sixth century, but earlier versions of the language existed, including the Safaitic dialect, an old Arabic dialect used by the pre-Islamic nomadic inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert. Some of its inscriptions date back to the first century.Proto-Arabs are presumed to have originated from what <strong>is now modern-day Hejaz and Najd in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Arabs spread from there to the central and southern parts of the Levant, sometimes replacing previously spoken Semitic languages. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media.[9] Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and the Hadiths were written in Arabic.[10]Arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of Muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by Muslims. Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),[12] Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia[13] and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish and other Semitic languages such as Abyssinian in medieval times and languages such as English and French in modern times and some loanwords from theArabic is the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Arabic[14] is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[15][16][17][18] All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,[19] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world.[20] Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, which is an abjad script and is written from right to left, although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ASCII Latin from left to right with no standardized orthography. <strong>Arabic and Islam</strong></p><p>Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the Quran. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of Islam because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.</p><p>&nbsp; It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula 150 millions people speak Arabic&nbsp; to learn its vocabularies you should listen to Arabic speakers in every field listen before speak the Arabic grammar&nbsp; &nbsp;is very important to know the structure of the sentence s </p><p>how can I speak like native&nbsp; listen to drama listen to old songs listen to sport listen to cartoon video clips&nbsp; &nbsp;all in Arabic try to repeat the words and phrases</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4513058", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "CompTIA A+ Certification ( 220-1002) Practice Exams", "level": "All Levels", "author": "AFAQ Formations", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "2", "students": "1456", "coupon_code": "569F447D34381B49FD46", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4513058_1828.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-certification-220-1002-practice-exams/?couponCode=569F447D34381B49FD46", "end_day": "2022-04-07 20:11:00+00:00", "headline": "Feel confident and Get CompTIA A+ Certification ( 220-1002) (Core 2) on your first try!", "description": "<p><strong>What Exactly Is Certification?</strong></p><p>Certification is an amazing pathway to getting a high paying career in some of the best jobs in the world without spending thousands of dollars attending a four-year college.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Get Ready To Prepare Like You\u2019ve Never Prepared Before</strong></p><p>As we often say at AFAQ Formations, work smarter not harder.
